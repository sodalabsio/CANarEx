{"major_topic":"\nINDIGENOUS EDUCATION (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2006 ","minor_topic":"\nSecond Reading ","speaker":"Gary Douglas Hardgrave","content":"I move:\n\nThat this bill be now read a second time.\n\nThe primary purpose of this \n\nThis funding will be used for additional tutorial assistance, support for community festivals for Indigenous youth, health promotion, activities addressing substance abuse by Indigenous youth in remote regions, and delivering school based sporting academies and related activities for Indigenous students.\n\nThe Australian government places enormous importance on achieving better educational outcomes for Indigenous students. To achieve this, new investment is absolutely necessary in the areas of schooling, vocational and technical education, and health related strategies. This government is committed to developing the capacities and talents of our First Australians, our Indigenous people, so they have the necessary knowledge, understanding, skills and values for a productive and rewarding life of their choosing.\n\nSome $14.5 million will be used to extend tutorial assistance programs to encourage year 9 Indigenous students to continue with schooling to complete year 12, thereby improving their educational and job prospects. This initiative has the benefit of engaging year 9 students and reducing drop-out rates from school at this very critical transition point. Tutorial assistance for Indigenous year 9 students will complement similar assistance already provided to year 10, 11 and 12 Indigenous students.\n\nUp to 5,000 Indigenous vocational and technical education students annually will also benefit from tutorial assistance program funding of $11.2 million. This initiative will be directed towards Indigenous students undertaking courses leading to the attainment of Australian Qualifications Framework Certificate Level III or above qualifications. Indigenous students are, sadly, underrepresented in courses at these levels. It is well recognised that attaining an AQF Certificate Level III or above qualification significantly increases the chances of employment.\n\nAnother initiative contained in this bill is directed towards giving young Indigenous girls and boys increased opportunities to engage in education and sports activities. Funding of $9.1 million is being sought for 18 school based sporting academies and related strategies. This funding will build on successful models of sporting academies that have helped Indigenous people engage positively in sport and succeed in education and later life. I pay tribute to the member for Canning for his very positive efforts in his electorate in piloting this program. This funding will provide a rolling out of the lessons learned so well in the strategies in the southern suburbs of Perth.\n\nIn 2007 the initiative will also enable more than 1,000 students to attend up to 12 sports academies, located within schools, offering a range of sports and recreation activities. With some 18 academies in place by the end of 2008, the participation of our First Australians will increase to an estimated 1,530 students from every state and territory.\n\nUp to some 16,000 young people annually will benefit from this government allocating $7.3 million to the Indigenous youth festivals initiative. This is a component of the Community Festivals for Health Promotion program. This program aims to, through Indigenous youth festivals, promote healthy and positive lifestyles, improve participation in education, increase vocational planning and reduce crime and drug abuse\u2014and they are very effective indeed.\n\nThe festivals are providing an opportunity to strengthen educational outcomes\u2014such as attendance at school and school engagement\u2014by integrating events of this nature into core curricula and practices of schools, particularly in remote areas such as Cape York and parts of Western Australia.\n\nFunding of $1.5 million will be used as part of a whole-of-government regional approach announced in September 2005 to address substance abuse\u2014diversionary and preventative education based projects that build upon the successes already achieved through the Australian government\u2019s Partnership Outreach Education Model. The POEM pilot will be introduced in the central desert and two other remote regions. These projects will help combat the critical issues of petrol sniffing and substance abuse and we are ambitious to engage up to 1,000 young people over four years.\n\nA further $100,000 from existing program resources is being made available to the National School Drug Education Strategy to assist in stopping young people from becoming involved in substance abuse activities.\n\nThis bill before the House will make an enormous difference. It is a deliberate investment as part of a whole-of-government commitment to our First Australians to make a difference in their lives through their formative years at school to ensure that they, through their own efforts and enterprise, can engineer a great sense of success in their own personal futures.\n\nI commend this bill to the House.\n\nDebate (on motion by ","groups":["First Nations","Young people","People with drug problems","People in regional or remote areas"],"issues":["Violence","Voice","Crime\/criminal justice","Addiction","Government assistance"],"date":1150934400000,"id":"92cb7070-8ea3-4d91-aeef-e0a72d2541c7","year":2006,"month":6}

AIATSIS has been absolutely central to the development of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies as a distinctive, unique and substantial field of study here in Australia. This work traverses many disciplines, including anthropology, education, art, health, linguistics\u2014you name it. Through its work, AIATSIS has truly become a cultural institution of international renown, so it deserves to be better known here and for there to be better awareness of it amongst as many mainstream Australians as possible. In my work with AIATSIS, I have seen the intimate knowledge that First Australians have of these lands that connect all Australians to what are the oldest continuing cultures on the planet.\n\nThis year, working together with the member for Indi and other colleagues, we've established a parliamentary friendship group to foster better collaboration and communication between AIATSIS and this parliament. Our hope is that, through this friendship group, we can raise greater awareness of the priceless collection of cultural and resource materials that are cared for by AIATSIS, and celebrate the dynamic Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures. The materials of AIATSIS are quite critical to recognising the immense knowledge and the diversity contained in Australian Indigenous languages and culture. Last month, AIATSIS came here to Parliament House to unveil their strategic plan for 2018 to 2023, and I was pleased to attend the launch event. It was really fitting, actually, given that one of their major focuses going forward is building engagement with governments and with a broader range of people right around our community. The member for Indi was at the launch; I'm pleased to see here in the chamber the member for Groom, who also attended the launch; and I'm also pleased to see the member for Dunkley here, given that he once worked at AIATSIS, some years ago.\n\nUnderpinning AIATSIS's strategic plan is a determination to be part of helping all Australians re-imagine what it means to be Australian, and to forge a national identity that embraces and celebrates the unique cultures of Australia's First Peoples. The vision of AIATSIS is a world in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's knowledge and cultures are recognised, respected, celebrated and valued. As the strategic plan highlights, AIATSIS occupies an incredibly important place in this capital and in our nation. It's a unique institution that works at the intersection between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, governments, the academy, and the cultural sector, along with the Australian and international publics.\n\nAIATSIS is the only national institution with an exclusive focus on the stories of 65,000 years of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures. The four priorities set out in its strategic plan are discovery, transformation, resurgence and extending its reach. Each of these priorities centres on the opportunities and possibilities of this time in the institute's history, as we are approaching AIATSIS's 60th birthday in the year 2024. Their strategic plan also sets out the underpinning commitments that define the institute and characterise its long-term approach to its work. Those commitments include AIATSIS's technical expertise and capability being sustained for national and regional impact; AIATSIS being characterised by an Indigenous voice in all that it does; AIATSIS being a financially sustainable organisation; and AIATSIS operating cohesively as a single entity, embodying the concept of yindyamarra\u2014that's a Wiradjuri word meaning honour and respect; more broadly, it implies thoughtfulness, graciousness and kindness. The commitments also include AIATSIS being positioned to influence across a range of sectors, having an innovative and flexible institution, and also, as I mentioned earlier, being proactively engaged and being an outward-looking institution.\n\nSince AIATSIS relocated to the Acton Peninsula here in Canberra in 2001, it's now in a prominent location. This has created a real opportunity to showcase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and the richness of the collections of AIATSIS in a manner never before possible.

{"major_topic":"\nBILLS ","minor_topic":"\nAppropriation Bill (No. 1) 2017-2018; Consideration in Detail ","speaker":"Sharon Claydon","content":"I would like to welcome New South Wales Minister John Ajaka, who is with us today. I congratulate the New South Wales Liberal government for their understanding of the importance of a genuine needs based funding model and for standing their ground on agreements that were struck but which this government fails to honour.\n\nToday, I want to draw the minister's attention to the detrimental consequences of his government's plans to cap places, introduce student fees and institute a tender process for university enabling courses. Make no mistake: the $3,200 fee being proposed by the Turnbull government will repel tens of thousands of low-income and disadvantaged students from enrolling in enabling courses, especially since these courses, unlike diplomas or bachelor degree programs, do not result in any formal qualification. Thousands of potential students will be locked out of higher education entirely. At a time when Australia should be staking our place in a global knowledge economy by investing in our people and developing our national skills base, it is utterly counterproductive to discourage participation in higher education\n\nAs the nation's oldest and largest provider of enabling programs, the University of Newcastle and the lower Hunter region more broadly has, perhaps, the most to lose from this proposal. The University of Newcastle currently runs three enabling programs\u2014Yapug, Newstep and Open Foundation\u2014which provide targeted training and tertiary study pathways for Indigenous and mature age students, as well as recent school leavers aged between 18 and 20. Together, these programs have helped over 42,000 students gain entrance into higher education since 1974. In fact, today close to 20 per cent of the current student cohort at the University of Newcastle entered their degree through an enabling program. That is how significant these programs are. They play a critical role in supporting thousands of disadvantaged students into degrees. Indeed, many participants are the first in their families to have attended universities. Many have to contend with multiple obstacles in order to succeed, but it is no coincidence that Newcastle has 1,000 Indigenous students enrolled. It is no coincidence that the University of Newcastle trains more than half of this nation's Indigenous doctors. Those incredible successes are directly attributable to the decades of hard work and Newcastle's steadfast commitment to delivering equity in education through high-quality enabling programs.\n\nLast month, I had the opportunity to meet an outstanding woman, Makayla Guest, a second-year Indigenous student at medical school at the University of Newcastle. Makayla directly credits the university's Yapug enabling program for allowing her to reach her potential. Her words tell the story much better than I could. Makayla said:\n\nNever in my remotest dreams would I have thought that I would have the opportunity to be studying to be a medical doctor. I never believed that I would have the ability to achieve and participate in something so meaningful. Not just meaningful to myself, but also, my family, my friends and my Mob.\n\nFor Makayla, and the tens of thousands of others just like her, it was the enabling program that gave her the confidence and the skills to undertake higher education. Like me, these students are deeply worried about this government's plan to cap places, introduce student fees and implement a tender process for universities' enabling courses.\n\nIndeed, since the 2017 budget was released, I have been inundated with heartfelt calls and messages, from current and former students as well as university staff, about the dire impacts this proposal will have for our communities. They are all asking similar questions. So, on behalf of them, I ask the minister: what is this government's commitment to equity in education? How will the next cohort of Indigenous students, of those who are first in family to go to uni, of women and of potential students from low income families gain access to university? With the exceptional successes of the University of Newcastle clear to see, why on earth would you consider contracting these programs out to private providers? Unlike universities, private providers have no specific equity mission or community obligations, and many have no previous experience in teaching students who have faced prior educational challenges. I ask the minister these questions.","groups":["First Nations","People living in poverty","General disadvantaged group"],"issues":["Voice","Negative emotions","Finance","(in)equality","General disadvantage"],"date":1497398400000,"id":"dde55103-c2eb-4306-8e28-65e295627257","year":2017,"month":6}
{"major_topic":"\nADJOURNMENT ","minor_topic":"\nFoetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder ","speaker":"Sharman Nancy Stone","content":"Yesterday was a watershed for the nation, with the minister, Fiona Nash, announcing the funding of the first National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Action Plan. There has been $9.2 million committed to this strategy. Of course, it is not enough; it is never enough. But this will be the first time that there is national recognition that we have a major epidemic in Australia of babies born with brain damage because their mothers drank during their pregnancies.\n\nThe elements of this national strategy followed from the 2012 recommendations of \n\nOf course, labelling of alcohol is just one of the ways in which we must address the fact that in Australia a significant number of women are still in denial or have never heard about the potential damage they do to their foetus if they drink while they are pregnant. Foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or foetal alcohol syndrome\u2014which is a more serious condition if the mother has been drinking\u2014is the biggest cause of nongenetic brain damage in the newborn in Australia today, and it is increasing in incidence. In our one prevalence study that has been undertaken very recently by an expert multidisciplinary team it was found that between 30 and 50 per cent of children in a small community had FASD as a consequence of their mothers drinking. That is the highest rate of incidence found anywhere in the world, and there is no reason for us, sadly, to think that that community\u2014which in this instance happened to be an Indigenous community\u2014is an unusual circumstance in Australia.\n\nLet me stress that FAS and FASD are not confined to Indigenous communities in Australia. In fact, the incidence of children being born with this brain damage goes right across our society and right across populations of different socioeconomic status. We have women who are older, professional women and who have been enjoying their red wine each night. They finally become pregnant and continue to say, 'Of course, I will have that red wine with my meal.' They do not understand that the consequences could be that their child is born brain damaged and with other serious and significant physical disabilities.\n\nWe continue to be in denial about the risks associated with drinking while pregnant because many GPs, gynaecologists, obstetricians and nurses\u2014those who should give women advice in their early pregnancy and during their pregnancy\u2014fail to talk about the dangers of consuming alcohol. Often tobacco is talked about, or diet and nutrition, but not the consumption of alcohol. So I am very pleased that this national strategy identifies that problem and will specifically address funds towards educating our medical professionals.\n\nA child with FASD\u2014especially a boy\u2014is most likely to end up in prison as a consequence of the cognitive impairment that they have and their incapacity to regulate their behaviour. We also have to educate the magistracy, the police forces, the social workers and the school teachers so that they understand what this condition is and how best to support a child who comes into their care, or who comes before them as an offender.\n\nI just want to talk very briefly about Troy, a 27-year-old man who was diagnosed with FASD in 2002 by a child development specialist. Troy just happens to be Indigenous, but this is not, as I said, an Indigenous story alone. Troy's mother had at least five other children after Troy was born, while continuing to use alcohol. A survivor herself of sexual child abuse and extreme poverty, she has only known violent relationships plus the added stress of losing her children to child protection services. There have been no male role models due to chronic alcoholism and high incarceration rates. Troy's early childhood experiences include the suicide of his father, several uncles and an aunt and he has been the victim of sexual abuse in homes where he sought shelter and while in custody. Troy celebrated one year out of prison on 30 April 2014. This is the longest time he has remained out of jail since he was 11 years old. Troy's life experience is typical of that of sufferers of FASD. Some 50 per cent of mothers with FASD children themselves have foetal alcohol spectrum disorder or foetal alcohol syndrome. These are tragedies the country cannot continue to ignore. At last we have a national strategy to tackle the problem.","groups":["First Nations","People living in poverty"],"issues":["Health care\/Health","Violence","Voice","Crime\/criminal justice","Negative emotions","Child protection","Poverty"],"date":1403740800000,"id":"d0628bf3-3bb8-401a-9956-b34629d47d3b","year":2014,"month":6}

I commend the nature of this resolution.\n\nI want to refer to another UN related area on Indigenous people. I was pleased to recently attend the Nepalese Indigenous Nationalities Forum's annual event at Campsie, with about 300 in attendance. Since 2006 this organisation has been about demonstrating the rights of Indigenous people in Nepal. It has been about making sure there is language preservation through the holding of conferences. I want to commend Ganesh Tamang and others for making sure that these issues are raised on behalf of indigenous Nepalese in Australia.\n\nWhere we do not have consent around the world we see realities such as the San people being thrown off their land in Botswana on behalf of De Beers and its diamond interests. We see the deforestation of Brazil and Peru and the throwing of people out of their villages and off their land without any consultation in regard to mining in those countries. We see the movement of large numbers of people into the Jumma people's lands in Bangladesh. I want to stress the work of Kabita Chakma in Australia. For a group that has only about 100 or 150 people in this nation, it has very much punched above its weight in raising these issues with the federal government. We see the situation of Uighurs and Tibetans in China, where there is not any consideration of their rights\u2014no role in their nation's representation, no consideration of their needs.\n\nWhilst the previous speaker who spoke in this debate said that we do things pretty well in Australia, I am not sure it is all that brilliant, quite frankly. We have a situation where life expectancy of Indigenous males is 11.5 years lower, and females 9.7 years lower, than non-Indigenous Australians. We know the \n\nThe government has moved ahead in regard to the Healing Foundation and the apology to Indigenous Australians. It has talked about concepts of closing this life-expectancy gap within a generation, halving the gap in the mortality rate and halving the gap for Indigenous students in year 12, or equivalent attainment rates, by 2020. These are noble sentiments. I appreciate that the government has also devoted money to increasing the understanding of Australians and the need to recognise Indigenous people in our Constitution. But we cannot pretend that things are pretty in Australia with regard to Indigenous Australians.\n\nI certainly commend this motion. I agree with the previous speaker insofar as whether you have seven Indigenous people in this parliament or four might not be, by itself, that crucial to Indigenous people's rights but it is a part of a broader agenda, as this resolution indicates. This declaration was adopted by a large variety of countries at an international conference. The organisations that were involved in it included the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the Mexican congress, the government of the state of Chiapas\u2014Chiapas historically had major conflicts in the nineties regarding Indigenous rights\u2014and the United Nations. It covers the gamut of things that can be done.\n\nIf we can make sure we do consider Indigenous rights when legislation comes before this parliament, if we can have sessions that do raise the awareness of these issues, then these are valuable things. To decry them as over-regulation or over-bureaucratisation is to run away from facing very significant problems in this country. As I said earlier, we can go around the world and see a wide variety of nations where Indigenous people are deprived of their rights, where their languages are disappearing because of lack of government support and where their culture is disappearing. I very much believe this resolution coming out of this conference is well and truly overdue.","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Health care\/Health","Negative emotions","Human rights"],"date":1345420800000,"id":"96e34922-9c10-4d34-bf1f-b4f3e8e5b440","year":2012,"month":8}

Labor supports the community broadcasting sector, recognising that it has experienced significant growth over the last four or five years in particular. It is a particularly important area for rural and regional Australians, as I am sure the minister is well aware. Some 70 per cent of the community broadcasting reach is in rural and regional Australia. They are not-for-profit communities who receive an extremely small amount of their total budget outlay\u2014some four per cent only\u2014from government funding. Of course, as the minister would be well aware, the work they are doing the diversity of services they provide is particularly important to the print handicapped, youth, Indigenous people, Christian broadcasting and a number of other areas.\n\nI draw the minister\u2019s attention to the fact that the funding for the Community Broadcasting Foundation itself, which disburses moneys to community broadcasters, whilst it was renewed, has remained stable for I think the last 10 years, despite the fact that growth in the sector has been considerable. A start-up grant for a new community broadcasting station is approximately $20,000, but the first-off amount is now capped at about $7,000. That puts additional pressures on the communities who want to see community broadcasting stations initiated in their area.\n\nIt is of great concern that the Australian Music Radio Airplay Project funding was not renewed.

Not surprisingly, everything he had to say today is totally false. Let us go to a few of the facts. It is the case that in 2006, following the closure of the Woomera detention centre, and then in 2007, following the closure of the Baxter detention centre, the previous government moved a number of demountables to Alice Springs. The previous government said at the time that they were going to use these demountables for the Alice Springs town camps. These are the facts. What actually happened was that the previous Minister for Indigenous Affairs decided to walk away completely from the Alice Springs town camp residents. Not one of these demountables was used by the previous government for the residents of the Alice Springs town camps. The reason that not one of these demountables was used is this that the previous minister decided to walk away completely\u2014to completely ignore the needs of the Alice Springs town camp residents.\n\nBy contrast, instead of walking away from the Alice Springs town camp residents this government has decided to use the demountables.

{"major_topic":"\nSTATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE ","minor_topic":"\nStynes, Mr Jim ","speaker":"Greg Andrew Hunt","content":"How do we define the life well lived? How do we explain a life so well loved as that of this particular man, Jim Stynes? I think the answer can be found in a simple proposition: generosity of spirit and enthusiasm of purpose. There have been of course many great footballers and many people in our society who have given of themselves, but it is hard to identify almost any other who has combined that sense of enthusiasm on the field with a generosity of spirit and passion for life off the field. That is what makes this story such a great Australian story, because it is the immigrant, the adventurer in the sense of somebody willing to participate in all the elements of life. It is the truly generous heart which defines, for me as an observer, the Jim Stynes story. I think that that is why there is such an extraordinary sense of empathy amongst Australians from all walks of life, Victorians in particular and, unusually, the young. This is a story which has gripped the young. The question is, how can a generation which is often dismissed as being so cynical, I think unfairly, be so engaged by such a story? I think it is because they cut through the silliness. They can see authenticity. They can see generosity. They can see a sense of bigness of purpose, which is beyond merely the self. That is what defined this person.\n\nOf course Jim Stynes was best known as a footballer but in the hierarchy of things, in my view, first and foremost he was a father, a dad, a husband. He was a great family man with Samantha, Matisse and Tiernan\u2014his wife, his daughter and his son. That is the greatest loss, as it would be in any of our circumstances. Beyond that, beyond the familial relationships Jim had with those closest to him, he was a figure who gave to those most in need within our community. That is his most profound contribution to our society. Sure, he was a great footballer\u2014a Brownlow medallist, a grand finalist, a four-times club champion, and an All Australian team member. He is the game's record holder for the most consecutive games\u2014244. It was as a social worker who came from the privilege of having been one of the leading AFL players that he really won his stripes with the community. He was much loved for what occurred on the field but he was even more loved for the fact that he did not seek the great prizes which came with fame and with privilege\u2014he took the opportunity and he turned it into a platform for converting young lives.\n\nThis was not some sort of dilettante; this was a person who was generous to the extreme and whose greatest joy in his post-football career was working in Indigenous communities, working with disadvantaged youth, working with each young person to give them the sense that their lives mattered, that each life had a sense of majestic possibility. The public knew that. The public got this guy. They could see that he was able to give of himself in a way which lifted others. That was the essence of what made this a special person who was elevated in the public's mind not out of a sense of flair, not out of a sense of talent but out of a sense of true generosity of spirit and the ability to transform the lives of others. It is the Reach Foundation, it is the personal engagement, it is the work with Indigenous communities that mean that this is not the mere passing of a person who had achieved fame or sporting prowess but the passing of somebody who has transformed individual lives through his sheer sense that he could give to others his own sense of purpose. Because of that we recognise a life which transcended what was possible for a young boy growing up in Dublin.\n\nOn the field Jim is the game's record holder for consecutive games. To me, that is a great achievement\u2014to play for 11 years through broken ribs and extraordinary injuries. It is the sense of Tennyson's Ulysses\u2014to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. It was a great life. We all are here in this place engaged with young people who look to move beyond the ordinary, who look to see something that is genuinely inspiring. In this case they found. There are a lot of disappointments out there when young people look around at the lives of the older citizens of society, and then there are moments that glisten\u2014and this is what makes the Jim Stynes story so great. For that we are thankful. We give our thanks to his family for the time they allowed him to be with the broader community. We are proud of what he achieved and he will live on in the Australian Rules game.

That is then accompanied by the investment in new medicines: a critical investment of $43 billion over the course of the coming four years. We've already delivered over 2,600 new medicines, but this budget specifically, for example, included the listing of Emgality for the treatment of migraine. That will help some thousands of patients save thousands of dollars a year.\n\nIn addition to that, the budget includes a very significant package in relation to hospitals. What we see is a $6 billion increase in the amount of funding for hospitals. From $13 billion when we came in, that will grow over the course of this budget to $26 billion, $27 billion, $28 billion and $29 billion a year. Then, of course, what we see is the fundamental investments in mental health and in aged care. There is $17.7 billion for aged care and, as part of that response to the royal commission, this package is built across five pillars.\n\nFirst is home care, with an over $7\u00bd billion investment, including 80,000 additional packages. We see here that we will have gone from approximately 60,000 aged-care packages when we came into government to 275,000, a rate of growth which is vastly in excess of the population growth, a rate of investment vastly in excess of the population growth in the over 70s or in any age group. So we had to take the situation as we inherited it, and we have addressed that challenge and it is fundamentally important. It also includes over $790 million under home care for support of respite, and that's to assist both older Australians and their carers\u2014critically and fundamentally important steps forward.\n\nThe second pillar, of course, is residential aged-care sustainability, and, as part of that, there's $7.8 billion, with several fundamental elements. The first is the increase, in line with the royal commission's recommendation, of a $10-a-day basic daily fee uplift. That's an investment of over $3.1 billion. The second is the adoption of the standards of safety and care, of 200 minutes a day of care, which will lead to a $3.9 billion increase over the course of the forward estimates or projections in the budget. The third is the residential aged-care quality and safety actions, and these include the ability to ensure we have over $300 million for doctors to make in-home visits to residential aged-care facilities, backed by an over $600 million investment in workforce\u2014in particular, with retention bonuses for nurses. Finally there is governance, with a nearly $700 million investment, which will be critical with all of the new steps that are being taken forward.\n\nWe've added to that $2.3 billion for mental health, which I will explore further on in the discussions. That's fundamental to saving and protecting lives, with a particular focus on youth suicide and Indigenous suicide prevention, and treatment right across the age groups.","groups":["First Nations","Young people","People with chronic health conditions"],"issues":["Shelter","Health care\/Health","Prejudice and discrimination"],"date":1624233600000,"id":"710b3378-1f8e-452f-af80-0dac0b081c41","year":2021,"month":6}
{"major_topic":"\nPRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS ","minor_topic":"\nAustralian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies ","speaker":"Cathy O'Toole","content":"I am very proud to represent one of the largest discrete Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in this country, Palm Island. Palm Island is home to the traditional owners, the Manbarra people. As Palm Island was used as a penal colony, it is also home to the Bwgcolman people, the Aboriginal name for 'one people'. There are approximately 47 language groups on Palm Island. Palm Island is a beautiful tropical island with a resident community that hovers between 3,500 and 5,000 people. The settlement has been known as Palm Island, the Mission, Palm Island Settlement or just Palm Community.\n\nThe history of Palm Island must be told to be believed. This year we celebrated the centenary of Palm Island. In a series of events throughout the year, we reflected on Palm's history, present day, and the future. The people of Palm Island are strong and resilient, and the truth of their story must be told. Palm Island has a bright future. The young people who are the leaders of the future have a vision for their communities. The Bwgcolman people have shown their endurance and resilience over the past hundred years. The Palm Island centenary celebration provided an opportunity for the people to speak truthfully about the past and the challenges and adversities that they have faced and overcome. As Palm Island looks towards a brighter future with the assistance of the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council, led by Mayor Alf Lacey, it is vital to share their stories with the broader community in order for us all to work together for better outcomes.\n\nThe Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies does remarkable work in collecting stories and doing research on the island. For those who are unaware of AIATSIS, it is a world-renowned research, collections and publishing organisation. AIATSIS promotes knowledge and understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures, traditions, languages and stories past and present. The organisation cares for a priceless collection, including films, photographs, video and audio recordings, as well as the world's largest collection of printed and other resource materials for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies. AIATSIS undertakes and encourages scholarly, ethical, community based research in a variety of sectors, including health, native title, languages and education. This research has also been done on Palm Island. I believe the AIATSIS CEO, Craig Ritchie, said it best when he described the organisation, saying, 'For more than 50 years, AIATSIS, a national cultural institution, has been the nation's best-kept secret.' Recently, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies unveiled \n\nWe are at a pivotal point in Australia with our First Nations people. We are at a pivotal point in Australia also where it is critical that we as a nation engage in a truth-telling process that will reveal our nation's real history. I believe, personally, that AIATSIS has a crucial role to play in this process. The organisation has incredible resources, collections, research and information about Australia's history and our current First Nations landscape. It is only right and fair that the organisation's next phase is to communicate, educate and engage with the wider community. To realise these aspirations, the organisation has set a series of initiatives as priorities for the life of the plan, which include a new state-of-the-art home for AIATSIS that is a national forum for transformational cross-cultural engagement and sharing; the songlines project, working with communities to secure song traditions; resources for the teaching of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and heritage in schools; a leading-edge, engaging web presence; and potential physical presence beyond Canberra. This is an ambitious plan, and rightly so in our current climate. AIATSIS is a national treasure, and I am proud to support the organisation and recognise the excellent work that they do for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and the country in this place.","groups":["First Nations","Young people"],"issues":["Protecting heritage"],"date":1543190400000,"id":"a2e4b644-9bbe-4459-8db6-0247eee38edd","year":2018,"month":11}
{"major_topic":"\nADJOURNMENT ","minor_topic":"\nCanberra Electorate: Trades Training ","speaker":"Gai Brodtmann","content":"Nearly two weeks ago the Prime Minister and the Minister for School Education, Peter Garrett, received a rock star reception when she officially opened the trade training centre at St Mary MacKillop in Isabella Plains in my electorate.\n\nThe trade training centre is the first of four in the Catholic school system in the ACT. The other three are at St Clare's College in Griffith in my electorate, and at Merici and St Francis Xavier colleges in the electorate of Fraser.\n\nThe opening had been months in the planning and was a major production\u2014almost an MGM production\u2014thanks to the event organisation skills of the wonderful team at St Mary MacKillop College. While I am grateful to the entire school community, and those of the schools in the area and region, I would particularly like to thank the principal, Michael Lee, and Sandra Darley, Garry Seary, Karen Hundy, Cindy Dean, Aiden Brunskil, Tony Lazzarato, Kim Maloney and Janelle Maas\u2014all from St Mary MacKillop College\u2014Mark Hogan, from the Catholic Education Office, and Father John Armstrong, parish priest from Corpus Christi\u2014the former Holy Family parish\u2014who did the blessing. He stepped in at the last minute because the Monsignor unfortunately had an accident. I would like to thank all of them for making the day such a success.\n\nThe Prime Minister and the minister were greeted by a procession of students at every turn from local schools: St Francis of Assisi, St Anthony's, St Clare of Assisi, Holy Family and the lovely parish of St Gregory's at Queanbeyan. Tyler Friend and Ashley Evans, the school chief captains, did a wonderful job of escorting the Prime Minister 'hither and yon'. Liam Pitt provided the acknowledgement of country and Liam Brown, the Indigenous Support Officer, performed on the didgeridoo. Maria Suraci, who has the voice of an angel, sang an evocative version of the national anthem, and little Joseph Sergi from St Gregory's in Queanbeyan had everyone in stitches with his speech and his reference to Joseph, Mary and baby Jesus as the first working family.\n\nIn honour of the Prime Minister's Welsh heritage, the choir sang the Sunset Prayer of Reverend Eli Jenkins from \n\nAs if that were not enough, the Prime Minister and Minister Garrett then went on a tour of the new trade training centre. The centre, which was built thanks to a $5.7 million investment across the four schools, trains students in hospitality and construction. The Prime Minister and Minister Garrett mingled with students and guests and shared a brief afternoon tea in Cafe Bella, which had been upgraded last year as part of the construction of the trade training centre. We also had the opportunity to experience and indulge in the wonderful food that was prepared in the new industrial kitchen that has been built as part of this trade training centre. The students did a beautiful spread and many of them are mini master chefs. We all ate way too much for an afternoon tea.\n\nThe Prime Minister and Minister Garrett also had the opportunity to speak with students who were developing basic woodwork skills and building a house on site.","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Protecting heritage"],"date":1330300800000,"id":"97d3cf19-182b-462c-8ffe-edd7c457ebb9","year":2012,"month":2}
{"major_topic":"\nADJOURNMENT ","minor_topic":"\nFilm Screening ","speaker":"Chris Patrick Hayes","content":"Last week I had the honour of hosting the premier screening of a documentary, \n\nI have on a number of occasions spoken in this place of the horrendous situation in which these minorities find themselves, largely following the involvement of the coalition of the willing in Iraq in 2003. They have been exposed to terrible acts of violence and persecution often to the point of death. They have also experienced a systematic loss of culture, heritage and language and are being forced to leave their traditional homelands.\n\nSince 2003, the Catholic Church has estimated that more than one million Christians have fled Iraq, leaving their homes and, in many cases, families in search of basic survival. They have fled to neighbouring Syria, Jordan, Turkey and Egypt just to be met, in some instances, with almost as dire a fate as what they have fled. Recent political unrest in some of these countries has made their circumstances highly distressing. There were even reports a couple of weeks ago of Syria deploying death squads to push back many of the Christian minorities over the border into Iraq.\n\nThis worsening state of affairs for the indigenous and Christian minorities in the Middle East made last week's film screening all the more timely and confronting. The screening was also timely considering that it was only last week that in this place we debated Australia's migration laws.\n\nA number of individuals who fled Iraq and who spent time at neighbouring refugee camps were lucky enough to eventually make their way to Australia as refugees. Many actually live in my electorate in Fowler. They waited patiently in the refugee camps for their turn to get a chance at a new life here or in other peace-loving countries that regularly open their doors to refugees on a very much humanitarian basis. Many of them were forced to leave their families behind in hope that one day they would be reunited in a country such as Australia.\n\nThese people would like be assured that the change in our immigration policy will remove any advantages or preferential treatment given to those who choose to pay the criminal element, people smugglers, in respect of buying a one-way ticket to this country. They want to know that, if they or their relatives apply for refugee status, they will be treated in an orderly and fair manner by this country. Removing any sort of preferential treatment for irregular boat arrivals through offshore processing was one aspect of the report of the expert panel adopted last week. Another important aspect that will certainly be welcomed by those who are concerned about a genuine humanitarian response includes the decision to increase our refugee intake to 20,000 per year with the eventual aim to increase it to 27,000 in five years. Adopting this recommendation demonstrates the compassion that Australia has towards genuine refugees.\n\nAs demonstrated by Mr Anton's film last week, there are a large number of those for whom getting to a country like Australia is the only chance of survival. I would like to thank the film producer, Mr Andre Anton, and Elmer Abbo, who assisted in the production, for travelling all the way from the US to give a voice to those suffering from this awful fate. I would also like to thank Hermiz Shahen, Deputy Secretary-General of the Assyrian Universal Alliance; David David, President of the Assyrian Australian National Federation; and Den Jadro, who accompanied them on the trip to Canberra, for all that they do in fighting for the protection of human rights of Assyrians and other minorities in Iraq.\n\nI would also like to thank all the members who attended the screening last week for demonstrating their support of the struggle of these minorities in Iraq. Madam Deputy Speaker, we have a moral responsibility to help these people find peace.

{"major_topic":"\nCONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS ","minor_topic":"\nLindsay Electorate: Australian Red Cross ","speaker":"David John Bradbury","content":"I rise to speak about my disappointment with the decision taken by the Australian Red Cross to close its voluntary aid service in New South Wales. The Red Cross movement right around the world performs outstanding work helping those most in need and is supported by global networks of dedicated volunteers, individual and corporate sponsors and the goodwill of the general community. The Australian Red Cross is no exception. They are at the front line of natural disasters and national tragedies, offering a consoling word while helping people to piece their lives back together. They played a key role in mobilising the nation to dig deep for the victims of the Victorian bushfires earlier this year and they perform outreach services in some of the most remote parts of the country with vulnerable Indigenous communities.\n\nAs one of the patrons of the Penrith branch of the Red Cross and as a long-time supporter of the organisation\u2019s activities in my community, I can attest to the incredible passion of the volunteers and the enormous contribution they have made over a long period of time. That is why I was disappointed to learn that the Red Cross plans to close the 95-year-old voluntary aid service in New South Wales. The VAS has sent qualified first aid volunteers to sporting and community events for almost a century, and I could not begin to imagine how many people have benefited from the work of these volunteers. The VAS does not charge a fee, which makes it an accessible first aid service for many struggling community and sporting organisations\u2014many of which are in the most disadvantaged communities and cannot afford to pay for the services of the New South Wales Ambulance or St John Ambulance.\n\nAny donations the VAS receives for its work are sent to the Red Cross to be included in its larger fundraising pool, which supports the full breadth of services the Red Cross provides. On 13 June this year, the men and women of the VAS were called to a meeting by the Red Cross and told that they no longer fell within the organisation\u2019s strategic priorities and they would be shut down, effective from 1 December. There was no consultation with any of the regiments before the decision was made, a process that has deeply hurt the volunteers who joined the VAS and donated their time on weekends and public holidays because they believed in the integrity of the Red Cross.\n\nIn my community, the 15 members of the Nepean VAS between them have more than 300 years worth of experience and the group\u2019s regional liaison officer, Mrs Yvonne Cassidy, has given 31 years of service to not only the Nepean VAS but also the broader Red Cross organisation. The Nepean VAS has been self-sufficient for a number of years and fundraises extensively for the Red Cross, even being named last year the most outstanding VAS regiment in New South Wales. In my view, the Red Cross is turning its back on the experience and dedication of these dedicated volunteers. I would hope that they recognise the incredible service that these volunteers and the VAS perform for the community and that they reverse this short-sighted decision.","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Crime\/criminal justice","Negative emotions","Government assistance","General disadvantage","Vulnerable"],"date":1252540800000,"id":"c8725c76-656e-4e85-b0d8-bbd28997fbcc","year":2009,"month":9}

{"major_topic":"\nPRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS ","minor_topic":"\nWorld Ranger Day ","speaker":"Luke Gosling","content":"There's not much that I can add to what the member for Lingiari has just said. He's been involved with rangers for a lot longer than I have, but I'll just make a couple of points. I think he summed up well, at the end, the importance of rangers to our nation. I want to reiterate that the work the rangers do is very dangerous. It's all relative, but when coupled with the tyranny of distance that we have in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland\u2014wherever rangers work\u2014the very nature of their work means they are far from support. They work in special and unique places where there are limited health services, and when things go wrong, as they invariably do, it can be fatal. During World Ranger Day we pay our respects to the rangers who've lost their lives or been seriously injured while at work. I know that communities near Gan Gan in Arnhem Land, in the member for Lingiari's electorate, are still in mourning over the loss of a ranger who was taken by a crocodile last October. These are the dangers that they face in the invaluable work that they do.\n\nThe conservation work done by these rangers is also invaluable in the protection of our precious and ancient environment. Rangers apply traditional knowledge to land and sea management. When that's combined with the latest science, our nation benefits. Whether it be fire management, which is becoming increasingly important, traditional burning, management of weeds and pests, protecting threatened species, or preserving stories and culture and handing them on to future generations and tourists\u2014it all benefits from the work of rangers on country.\n\nI'd like to take a moment to applaud the work done in the NT by the Caring for Country Branch of the NLC, the Northern Land Council. I acknowledge that there's a delegation from the Northern Land Council in the parliament today. Caring for Country hosts and provides administrative support for land and sea ranger groups and supports joint management of national parks and management of Indigenous protected areas, IPAs. The Northern Land Council currently services 12 ranger groups and jointly manages seven parks and reserves, including the World Heritage listed Kakadu National Park. The NLC actively supports the work of Aboriginal custodians to maintain their cultural obligations to care for this land and sea country through the Caring for Country Branch, which provides environmental and related support services to traditional owners who actively manage in excess of 200,000 square kilometres of land and sea country.\n\nIn my electorate of Solomon and the member for Lingiari's electorate is Larrakia country. I want to acknowledge the work done by the Larrakia rangers. They are a long-running urban-based ranger group. With income coming from both commercial enterprise and grant funding they have 22 rangers working across Larrakia land and sea country. When we talk about Larrakia land we're talking about the greater Darwin region, west across to the Cox Peninsula and east to the Adelaide River. This ranger group differs from other ranger groups as much of their effort is directed to commercial work, employment and training. The Larrakia partnership with a whole range of stakeholders and landholders is vital. I commend the work that they do. We know that improving local decision-makers and putting self-determination back in the hands of Aboriginal owners are key steps towards closing the gap. This is very important in the Northern Territory. Aboriginal owned and\/or managed land occupies around half of the Territory's landmass and 85 per cent of the coastline. There are currently 1,000 Aboriginal rangers operating across 46 established Aboriginal ranger groups. They manage 460,000 square kilometres of land. That's huge. It's a huge territory. It's also a huge estate being managed by the rangers. Again, I commend the work that they do.","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Voice","Protecting heritage","Government assistance","Finance"],"date":1567987200000,"id":"4e0356cc-d96f-43de-93ee-77cf4fd2d493","year":2019,"month":9}

I note the comment you made, Minister Gray, that there are about 1.5 million Australians who are not enrolled to vote. With 150 members in the House of Representatives, we are talking about 10,000 people per electorate, on average, who are not eligible to vote. All of us would have experienced checking the enrolment of people who contact us. Often the people who contact us, particularly if they are transient or if they have to come into a job or who recently have not bothered to vote, are not registered.\n\nMy electorate is named after Harold Blair, who was an Aboriginal activist and tenor. He is a very famous person. He grew up in the Purga Mission south of Ipswich. There are a number of important Indigenous institutions in Ipswich. There is an Indigenous school called Hymba Yumba in Springfield. Just before the census, I urged the people there to make sure that their mums, dads and carers fill out census forms. The biggest high school in Ipswich, Bremer State High School, has about 1,500 students. About 30 per cent of those are Indigenous or Polynesian, with most of that 30 per cent being Indigenous. One of the busiest medical centres in Ipswich is Kambu Medical Centre. It has tens of thousands of patients. It is an Indigenous centre.\n\nThere are about 86,500 people on the electoral roll in Blair. We are celebrating this year 50 years since Indigenous people achieved the right to vote in federal elections. I understand that it was not compulsory to enrol but once you were enrolled it was compulsory to vote. In 1967, the Constitution was changed to give power to count Indigenous people in the census and for the Commonwealth to be given the power to make special laws for their benefit.\n\nMy question relates to the Electoral Commission. I have stood at polling booths in Ipswich for about 30 years handing out Labor Party pamphlets\u2014the opposition side would call them propaganda but I would call them pamphlets\u2014encouraging people to vote for the Australian Labor Party candidate. I recently stood all day at Raceview State School\u2014the biggest state primary school in my electorate in Ipswich\u2014and one of the things that struck me about this suburb, which is fairly typical of Ipswich, was how few Indigenous people came to the polling booth to cast a vote. What steps are the AEC taking to encourage Indigenous people to vote? What are the budgetary implications? Does the AEC require any additional funding to get all Australians, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, to participate in the political process?","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Government assistance","Finance"],"date":1340150400000,"id":"408908ba-24b5-4aa7-8ebd-f1686cf5d10b","year":2012,"month":6}
{"major_topic":"\nPRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS ","minor_topic":"\nWorld War II ","speaker":"Laurie Donald Thomas Ferguson","content":"I congratulate the member for Fremantle on moving this motion not only to outline the specifics of the Second World War incarceration but because it represents a broader international problem. After the Second World War, Stalin deported hundreds of thousands of Chechens, Volga Germans and Crimean Tatars. In Czechoslovakia the government expelled hundreds of thousands of Sudeten Germans. This is symptomatic of societies that distrust their citizens in times of conflict. I do not want to cover extensively the Second World War situation\u2014other members have\u2014but there are some very worrying historical patterns in this country. In the First World War, because we had doubts that King Constantine would stay onside with the allies, every Greek family in this country was investigated by the precursor of ASIO, who went to their neighbours and asked them about their loyalty. In the Riverina, particularly, in both world wars the large number of German settlers were very heavily persecuted and the names of towns were changed. I had the opportunity in my political career to discuss this with Tim Fischer, a previous National Party member from the Riverina, whose own family endured these kinds of circumstances. It was not here of course. In the United States, although they only incarcerated one per cent of Hawaii's huge Japanese population, 100,000 Japanese in the United States were incarcerated. It was only Reagan's apology in 1998 that put some end to that.\n\nSimilar events occurred in this country. Sir Henry Bolte was probably one of the toughest politicians this country has ever produced and was famous for hanging Ronald Ryan. If you go to this country's National Archives and listen to his oral history, he said that throughout his political career he always dreaded that the Australian people would find that he was of German extraction. In the Riverina, in Mildura, and in the Albury area we incarcerated two Lutheran ministers because they might have been pro Nazi. One of them, unfortunately, was a Lutheran convert from Judaism. A person active in Sydney's Jewish community, Josie Lacey, tells the story that, when she arrived here as a Jewish refugee, she and her family were so distrusted that they were not allowed to live on the coastline near Bondi or Vaucluse. They were moved out to Wentworthville because they might otherwise communicate with German submarines.\n\nMy local Guilford chemist is of Italian extraction and told the story that throughout the Second World War his father was forced to work for the Catholic Church from Monday to Friday, basically for nothing, and only come home on weekends. We have a situation in this country where, in times of conflict, minorities are doubted and there is no respect for their citizenship of this country. Amongst the 7,000 incarcerated during the Second World War, 1,500 were nationals and were actually British citizens.\n\nThere are other things I had not heard about. One thing I came across when reading about this resolution was an incident that I was previously unaware of. At Cape Bedford in Northern Queensland, because the local Lutheran pastor was a German, they moved 250 Aboriginal Australians to Cooktown and Cairns because we could not trust them because they had a Lutheran pastor. Of those people, 28 died in the first month because of the change of temperature and climate and, eventually by March 1943, 60 of them had perished. We pride ourselves on multiculturalism and, of course, we are a world leader. But these are things we should be very careful of. As I say, in times of frantic nationalism and patriotism, these kinds of mentalities and situations arise.\n\nAnother incident in this country happened in Broken Hill, where rioters burned down the German club and a large number of other properties connected with Germans. It is a situation that is very damning. The major writer in this area is Klaus Newmann author of \n\nThe dimensions of this are that people were ostracised by their neighbours, by the people that they went to school with and by their friends, they were marginalised in society and not trusted, their lives were basically torn asunder and careers that they might have aspired to were destroyed. All of these are things that are very integral to the resolution that the member for Fremantle has moved. I recommend it very strongly to the House and congratulate her endeavour in an important issue.","groups":["First Nations","Migrants and refugees","Racial minorities"],"issues":["Crime\/criminal justice"],"date":1332115200000,"id":"a0b2a63d-a429-479d-a605-593666a678ff","year":2012,"month":3}
{"major_topic":"\nQUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE ","minor_topic":"\nIndigenous Communities ","speaker":"Mal Thomas Brough","content":"I thank the member for Solomon for his genuine interest in this disturbing area. Unfortunately, since the allegations and the statements by Nanette Rogers from the Northern Territory DPP earlier in the year, there has been a steady flow of commentary both in the press and in direct correspondence to my department about very serious allegations of both sexual and violent crimes against women and children, in particular boys, in many remote communities. These are things that I am sure disturb all of us in this House.\n\nI want to bring the House up to date with some of the steps that have been undertaken by the federal government subsequent to our summit into the violence and sexual abuse, where the federal government committed $130 million to try and address some of these serious issues with the provision of additional police, through bilaterals with states and territories and by instigating a national intelligence desk which will be operating from Alice Springs early next month. That will build on the success of the Central Australia intelligence desk dealing with interdiction of illegal substances, which has been very successful and again has been a commitment from the Howard government to those communities.\n\nI was in Alice Springs last Saturday and I announced that the dog sniffer team that we had committed back in May had been accepted by the Territory government. I commend the Territory government for adding additional dog teams to this one so that there will be two stationed in Alice Springs, and through the APY lands in South Australia and through the central desert areas we can take further steps in removing individuals who are supplying illicit substances to these communities. There is much more to be done. The bilaterals are coming along. South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales have signed up. We will be having further negotiations with the Territory, Queensland and the other states early next month.\n\nGoing back to the original question from the member for Solomon, he asked about whether I am aware of any further allegations. I am also aware of the allegation of the rape of a 12-year-old boy in Maningrida in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. This was reported to some small extent, considering this is alleged to have occurred over a three-month period. A 12-year-old male was raped by five juveniles and five adults from that community. It raised with me the concern I have as to why this had not been more widely reported, as I am sure it would have been in almost any other part of the country. One of the conclusions I have come to is that unfortunately with Maningrida, like so many other remote Indigenous communities, people still require permits to go there. They need to seek the permission of a select group in order to be able to go directly to these communities.

{"major_topic":"\nPRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS ","minor_topic":"\nAustralian Flag ","speaker":"Jane Prentice","content":"I move:\n\nThat this House:\n\n(1) recognises that on 3 September 2014 ('Australian National Flag Day') we celebrate the\n\n(2) 113th birthday of the Australian flag; and\n\n(3) notes that:\n\n(a) Australia's flag was the first in the world to be chosen in an open public competition, and this flag design competition brought forth the pride of a newly formed nation by attracting entries from 1 per cent of our population at that time;\n\n(b) on 3 September 1901, Lady Hopetoun, wife of the first Governor-General of the new Commonwealth of Australia, formally opened the Commonwealth Flag and Seal Exhibition and announced the names of the successful competitors;\n\n(c) the winning design was a Blue Ensign including the Union Jack, along with a Southern Cross and a six pointed star;\n\n(d) this latter star (the 'Commonwealth Star') was changed to the seven pointed star we are familiar with today in 1908, to signify the Territory of Papua and future Territories; and\n\n(e) the new flag represents a design by the people, for the people, and since it was first flown in 1901, has become an icon of our shared identity.\n\nI rise today to celebrate the 113th birthday of the Australian national flag on Wednesday, 3 September, and I thank the member for Bass for his support. The Australian flag represents us as a free and democratic people and symbolises our heritage, traditions and identity. Our flag is indeed unique. It is the only flag to fly over an entire continent. It is also the first ever to be chosen by an open public competition, with more than 32,000 designs entered by men, women and children.\n\nOn 3 December 1901 our flag was flown for the first time. The six colonies had united to form the Commonwealth of Australia, and our flag became the symbol of this union. Lady Hopetoun, the wife of the first Governor-General of the new Commonwealth, announced the names of the successful competitors. Equal first place was given to five almost identical designs belonging to Australians from different walks of life. They were an artist, an optician's apprentice, an architect, a ship's officer and a schoolboy. Each symbol on our flag has a special meaning, representing our history, our unity as a federation and our geography. The Union Jack acknowledges the historical links we have to Great Britain. The Commonwealth star represents the six states, with a seventh point added in 1908 to signify the territories. And the Southern Cross, a constellation only seen in the Southern Hemisphere, represents our location in the world. However, more importantly it acknowledges the first people of Australia, as the Southern Cross is a significant part of most Aboriginal stories of the Dreamtime.\n\nOur nation has changed and grown since the beginning of Federation, and our flag continues to unite all Australians. It has become an icon of our shared identity. As a life member of the National Flag Association of Australia, I wholeheartedly believe in the importance of our flag, and I commend the ongoing advocacy by Allan Pidgeon and his dedicated committee. It unites us as a nation in good times as we celebrate the achievements and successes of our countrymen and countrywomen, and it keeps us strong in times of tragedy and sorrow, reminding us we have the support of a whole nation. For more than 100 years Australian men and women have served under our flag, sacrificing their lives for the good of our nation. It is important that we recognise the significance of our flag as a symbol of the bravery and courage of our service men and women, and that we pay tribute to them every time it is raised.\n\nThis is done not only in Australia but also in other parts of the world. Our flag is raised every morning in the village of Villers-Bretonneux in France in memory of the thousands of Australians who lost their lives while liberating the village during the First World War. Our flag is a constant symbol and reminder of what it means to be Australian, and signifies the Australian traditions of mateship and courage. Our unique traditions were formed under our flag, and we acknowledge the sacrifices made and the hardships the generations before us went through to make Australia the safe and free country it is today. Our flag serves as a reminder of the contributions of past and current generations, and the significance of this will be passed on to our future generations. One of the co-designers of our flag, 14-year-old schoolboy Ivor William Evans, believed the representation of the Southern Cross was a symbol of Australia's bright future as a leading nation. He showed great foresight, as we are now privileged to call Australia a world leader, and the upcoming G20 summit is an example of this. It is excellent when we see our younger citizens showing pride and respect for our national symbol. Our youth of today are just as passionate about the significance of our flag, which was designed generations ago.\n\nEarlier this year I received a letter from the very proud grandfather of one of my young constituents, David Cameron. It included David's assignment on the importance of the Australian flag and why we should keep it unchanged. This reiterates the significance and importance of our flag to young Australians and displays the respect shown for our national symbol. Our flag was designed by the people and belongs to the people. It is an important expression of national pride.\n\nToday we celebrate pride in our flag and our nation and celebrate the symbol that binds us all. We are a country that continues to flourish, and it is with great privilege that we do this under our flag created by Australians over 100 years ago. I encourage all Australians to make a special effort to fly or display our flag, especially on its 113th birthday, next Wednesday.","groups":["First Nations","Young people"],"issues":["Protecting heritage","Finance","Harms and burdens"],"date":1409529600000,"id":"cda663ad-3fed-4337-a73f-f043e6f5b87d","year":2014,"month":9}
{"major_topic":"\nADJOURNMENT ","minor_topic":"\nSydney Harbour Federation Trust ","speaker":"Zali Steggall","content":"As a proud Sydneysider I rise to highlight the importance of one of our most loved and cherished assets, our beautiful harbour and the unique pockets of protected bushland that surround it. In my area of Warringah, I refer specifically to Chowder Bay, Georges Heights, Middle Head and North Head Sanctuary. These are truly iconic sites, sitting at the gateway of Sydney Harbour. To Indigenous communities, the traditional custodians, these places are sacred, holding great cultural and spiritual significance. Over the centuries, European settlers also appreciated the tremendous beauty of these sites but saw their strategic importance for defence. Ironically, the use of these sites for military purposes meant they were largely untouched by development. As a result, in September 1998 the Commonwealth government was able to put in place a unique form of protection by creating the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. This statutory agency was tasked with rehabilitating former Defence and other Commonwealth lands around Sydney Harbour, conserving their natural and built heritage and returning them to the people of Australia. These lands had been hidden away from public view for many years, left derelict, run-down and, in some cases, contaminated. In his speech announcing the harbour trust, the then Prime Minister, John Howard, described Sydney Harbour as:\n\n\u2026 probably the world's greatest harbour. It is one of the great natural beauty spots of our nation. It is the cradle of European settlement in Australia and it is one of those parts of our country which gives immense pride and immense pleasure, not only to the residents of Sydney, but also to all Australians because it wins such wide acclaim around the world.\n\nI couldn't agree more.\n\nThe creation of the trust followed years of lobbying by community groups adamant that these extraordinary places on Sydney Harbour should be maintained as public spaces and kept safe from redevelopment. These groups, collectively known as Defenders of Sydney Harbour Foreshores, included Friends of Cockatoo Island, the Headland Preservation Group and Foreshore 2000 Woolwich. Today, 22 years later, I thank them for their foresight and vision and their dedication to protect our beautiful environment. The threat was real that these sites would be developed\u2014prime real estate with breathtaking harbour views. It was only through the hard work of those community groups and the vision and leadership of Prime Minister John Howard that the land was saved.\n\nBut now that legacy is under threat, as are these precious parcels of unique bushland. The trust is currently the subject of a review, and the community has very real concerns that this could lead to these areas being left unprotected and ripe for development. The trust was established as a transitional body, to rehabilitate sites and hand them over to the New South Wales government for inclusion in the national parks and reserves system for ongoing management. But the question must be asked: what risk does this pose to these sites and what legislative safeguards will apply? There needs to be transparency and accountability as to the future of these iconic sites. As stated by the harbour trust itself, these sites must be maintained and kept safe from redevelopment.\n\nMy view, and the view of the general community in Warringah is that the Commonwealth should fund the trust on an ongoing basis to rehabilitate the sites and maintain them. These sites have great meaning for not only the people of Warringah but all Australians, due to their iconic location, their rich Aboriginal heritage, their military history and, of course, their environmental value. As they are sites of national significance, it is right and proper that the Commonwealth take ownership of their ongoing care and protection.\n\nIn closing, I would like to thank the members of the Headland Preservation Group, the North Head Sanctuary Foundation, the Mosman Parks and Bushland Association and the Friends of Quarantine Station. These hardworking volunteers have fought to conserve these areas, protect them from the risk of development and maintain them as sanctuaries to be enjoyed and loved by all Australians. I call on the government to honour the work of these volunteer groups, to respect the wishes of the local communities and to maintain the legacy of former Prime Minister John Howard by committing to ensuring that these iconic sites are protected for generations to come.","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Protecting heritage","Finance","Inclusion\/Exclusion"],"date":1581552000000,"id":"6b5c0839-bc3a-402e-ab98-846248a5fbaf","year":2020,"month":2}
{"major_topic":"\nQUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE ","minor_topic":"\nDiabetes ","speaker":"Greg Andrew Hunt","content":"I want to thank the member for Kennedy for his important and wide-ranging question. I was only today discussing the issue of Indigenous diabetes with his neighbour and my very good friend, the member for Leichhardt, who shares an equal passion on this topic and on this issue. We know that Indigenous diabetes incidence for over 18s is about 11 per cent, about triple the national average. For the 10- to 14-year-olds, it's at eight times the national average. The points that he makes are fundamentally correct and significant.\n\nIn terms of what we're doing, specifically for Indigenous communities, we're allocating about $207 million to the Integrated Team Care Program for Indigenous Australians, with a very specific focus on diabetes treatment and diagnosis and ensuring that people have the best long-term pathway. The other thing we have is a $67 million program for chronic disease within Indigenous communities, which has the capacity to do much more on country rather than, as the member says, just on the coast. There's a very significant pathway to expand and to extend that program onto Indigenous land and to the actual communities themselves.\n\nIn addition to that, at the broader national level, which can apply very specifically to Indigenous communities, the National Diabetes Services Scheme is an over $200 million program this year alone. We have also just extended continuous glucose monitoring by $54 million. All of those things come together. But I think we can do more for Indigenous diabetes in terms of both prevention and treatment. In terms of prevention, I want to invite the member to work with me, Indigenous communities and other members in this House who represent large Indigenous communities on that work.","groups":["First Nations","People with chronic health conditions"],"issues":["Health care\/Health","Prejudice and discrimination"],"date":1540252800000,"id":"8b8d11ad-d179-408b-82ff-c0239ac403ff","year":2018,"month":10}

What was even more groundbreaking and inspirational was the fact this team was entirely Indigenous. From all accounts, the team of 13 cricketers, who were mostly from a Victoria's western district, were warmly welcomed in England, playing 99 games of high-quality cricket over 125 days. Back in Australia, the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority had told the team that they could not sail, so the team decided they would 'go fishing'. They're fishing trip began in Queenscliff aboard a steamship then made its way to Botany Bay and then on to England.\n\nOn the weekend, I attended Queenscliff's commemorative cricket match between the home team of Anglesea and the Queenscliff team. It was a fascinating moment in our history, a time when inclusivity, acceptance and sporting endeavours overrode racism, division, violence and the tyranny of distance. Thank you to Borough of Queenscliff and the mayor, Ross Ebbels, for hosting this historic cricket match. It really was splendid.\n\nI would also like to acknowledge the Mullagh Wills Foundation, which has worked over many years to increase community awareness of this exciting story. The foundation's title is derived from the lead member of the Indigenous team, Johnny Mullagh, and coach, Tom Wills. A leather-bound message book recording and celebrating the tour was presented by the foundation's Ian Coutts to the mayor of Queenscliff on the occasion. The book has retraced the tour's path with signatures and commemorative statements provided by the Queen and Aboriginal elders. Overall, it was a fantastic event, and I congratulate all involved.\n\nYesterday I attended the Wallington Strawberry Fair. What an amazing event. With the event celebrating its 40th anniversary, who would have thought that this small fundraiser at the Wallington Primary School would become a region's signature event for homegrown produce, arts and culture attracting tens of thousands of visitors and contributing much to the local economy. It was a pleasure to catch up with school principal, Glen Lauder, who gave me some really fascinating facts. This fair is run by hundreds of parents and volunteers, and all funds go to the school, upgrading the sporting facilities and learning environments. I'd like to commend the school community for its efforts and urge this federal government to do more to fund our fantastic public schools, because we want every child to have the best start in life.","groups":["First Nations","Older people"],"issues":["Violence","Prejudice and discrimination","Inclusion\/Exclusion"],"date":1583107200000,"id":"95b48705-3c8e-454a-b160-edc4a53ca258","year":2020,"month":3}

It was held this week. It gave us the opportunity to look at the detail of those amendments. They are, for all intents and purposes, sensible amendments which should be made, and this House should be supporting them. That is why we will support them today.\n\nWe envisage that there may be further amendments as a result of further inquiries into the NDIS, and that is to be expected because this is very much a work in progress. The NDIS will not be fulfilled in the way that everybody aspires to for many years. That is going to take a considerable amount of work and cooperation not only here at the Commonwealth level but between the Commonwealth and the states and territories over what may be the next two or three terms of this parliament. Such a monumental change as this one, I believe, signals something about the approach of all us in this place to an issue whose time has come, in terms of ensuring that there is the best treatment that we can possibly put in place and afford for people who have disabilities, particularly those with profound disabilities, in Australia.\n\nQuestion agreed to.","groups":["First Nations","People with disabilities"],"issues":["Finance","Prejudice and discrimination"],"date":1363219200000,"id":"1a2e6ff7-0e07-454c-868b-1c45572b22f0","year":2013,"month":3}

As a White Ribbon ambassador and a father of two daughters, I am very keen to make sure that we eradicate domestic violence and violence against women in this country.\n\nLast Thursday night I joined the Ipswich Women's Centre Against Domestic Violence and members of the Ipswich community in the annual Walk a Mile in Her Shoes event for the third consecutive year. I spoke at the rally afterwards. Created in California in the US by Frank Baird in 2001, the Walk a Mile in Her Shoes event is based on the old saying, 'You can never really understand another's experience until you've walked a mile in their shoes.' So it is an event which encourages men to do the right thing. I marched with my traditional Ipswich 'Say no to domestic violence' T-shirt and in my RM Williams boots. I did not join the Ipswich Jets Rugby League team and Councillor Andrew Antoniolli wearing red stilettos, but I did march with Senator Claire Moore, the shadow minister for women, and the Labor candidate for Ipswich, Jennifer Howard.\n\nSadly, in this country one woman dies every week as a result of domestic violence. We should have conversations around the lounge rooms and kitchens about how we treat women and how we talk of them in workplaces, around the barbecue and on football fields and in clubs. We cannot brush this issue under the carpet.\n\nAnother great event which is happening in my electorate as we speak today, right now, is the Ipswich Housing and Support Services initiative of a Domestic and Family Violence Tenancy Session, of which I am a proud sponsor. The Ipswich Housing and Support Services contribution to Domestic Violence Awareness Month is centred on the issue of the rights of tenants and the options available to them when domestic and family violence occur in a private rental.\n\nSadly, as shadow minister for Indigenous affairs, I have to look through the press releases of the Minister for Indigenous Affairs and, as I did so this week, I looked at the budget that was handed down. I looked at the new streamlining of funding in relation to individual programs and, sadly, even in the new streamlined cuts of $534 million to Indigenous affairs, there was no mention of continued support for the programs run in relation to violence against women and children. Indeed, Antoinette Braybrook, the national convener of the Aboriginal Family Violence Prevention and Legal Service, condemns the government for their comments and says:\n\nWhere is the commitment to keep Aboriginal women and children safe? Where is the commitment to ensure Aboriginal women's access to justice? And where is the commitment to reduce vulnerability to violence?\n\nShe is calling on the government to do the right thing by Indigenous women in this country and to provide 'certainty and additional resources' for culturally and physically safe services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women.","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Shelter","Violence","Human rights","(In)justice","Vulnerable"],"date":1400112000000,"id":"42d84da9-1d55-4fa1-8c90-370366fd846d","year":2014,"month":5}
{"major_topic":"\nADJOURNMENT ","minor_topic":"\nRoyal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry ","speaker":"Mark Christopher Butler","content":"The banking royal commission has so far uncovered truly outrageous tales of corruption and appalling behaviour, including charging the dead, preying on the elderly and the disabled, and defrauding Indigenous Australians. This Prime Minister, as Treasurer, voted against establishing a royal commission into his mates at the big banks 26 times. He derided the notion as a populist whinge and as recklessness, and he tried to frame the calls for a royal commission as a mere political ploy from Labor. Indeed, when finally setting up the royal commission, the now Prime Minister said it was only because politics was doing damage to our banking system that he had done so. In reality, it has been our banking system which has been doing damage\u2014damage to thousands of ordinary Australians, destroying lives, homes and families.\n\nDi and Max Lock from my electorate used to run the Naracoorte Hotel in the south-east of South Australia. They're small business people who have always run small businesses and are justifiably proud of their record. In 2008 the Commonwealth Bank purchased Bankwest, which financed the Locks, and they were assured at the time that there would be no changes to the loan or their operations. Just a few weeks later, though, their accountant started receiving calls and emails saying that the bank did not want to refinance the Locks' successful business because the value of the Naracoorte Hotel wasn't high enough, all through an internal decision around revaluation by the bank. Once their loan facility expired, they would have to pay out the entire amount. They'd never missed a mortgage payment, yet the bank took their home and business. The bank wasn't interested in the consistent, reliable mortgage payments by the Locks; it just wanted to get rid of the old customers. The Locks lost everything. Their story was never heard by the royal commission, nor were the stories of thousands of others whose Bankwest loans were quickly disposed of despite no failings on the part of the borrower.\n\nThe Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, Kate Carnell, in her December 2016 report into the treatment of small business owners, found that the banks had used clauses that gave them extraordinary powers against borrowers, even where the borrower had acted within the terms of the loan at all times. These clauses allowed what happened to the Locks and thousands of others. They allowed the bank to revalue their properties and change the loan based on that unilateral revaluation. They allowed the banks to call in the entirety of the loan without cause. They allowed the banks to act to create non-monetary defaults. The banks claim they didn't do this, of course, but the ombudsman found that they did. She found not only that they did so but that they did so in almost 66 per cent of cases that she examined. In her view, one-third of claims against the banks had no fault on the banks' part, one-third involved fault on both the borrowers' and the banks' part, and in fully one-third of cases the fault was entirely due to the conduct of the banks and not at all due to the conduct of the borrowers. When this conduct came before the royal commission, non-monetary defaults were skimmed over because there was, in their words, 'no financial motive', yet that is not what the ombudsman found and it is not the experience of thousands of victims.\n\nEven where borrowers have been able to secure loans with other banks, they were thwarted by the practices of the Commonwealth Bank, which had taken over Bankwest. The Prime Minister has encouraged people unhappy with their banks to switch, and that's exactly what some victims tried to do. In one case, a business owner, told that his loan facility would not be continued with Bankwest, sought refinancing through Westpac, and it was granted, but, two days before the finance went through, Bankwest placed his business into receivership. He had never missed a payment.\n\nThis banking royal commission has been too rushed. This government had to be dragged kicking and screaming to do it in the first place, and now it has pushed it to a time line that means that thousands of stories, thousands of victims, and thousands of wrongs are not being told. The royal commission must be extended so that it can hear all of the victims' voices. The Locks thought that they would have their day to tell their story, and instead they have been silenced again.","groups":["First Nations","Older people","People with disabilities"],"issues":["Voice","Crime\/criminal justice","Finance","Prejudice and discrimination"],"date":1537315200000,"id":"6d61c9c9-de7d-499a-94bd-37f31214c5ad","year":2018,"month":9}
{"major_topic":"\nBILLS ","minor_topic":"\nAppropriation Bill (No. 1) 2015-2016; Consideration in Detail ","speaker":"Shayne Kenneth Neumann","content":"The budget ceases the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing and a $5.5 billion investment which was not due to expire until 2018. It is a significant amount of funding\u2014about $1.3 billion available to be rolled out over the remaining years of the agreement.\n\nThe 2014 progress review of the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing reported more than 1,600 new houses and 5,200 refurbishments have been completed between 2008 and 2013. States and territories have continued to achieve and exceed targets for construction and refurbishment, with another 531 new houses constructed and 839 refurbishments completed in 2013-14. The government will replace the national partnership agreement with a new remote Indigenous housing strategy over three years, totalling $1.1 billion, according to the budget.\n\nCan the parliamentary secretary confirm how many new houses have been constructed and how many refurbishments have been completed under the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing? What were the construction targets for the remaining years of the agreement? How many houses and refurbishments are states and territories required to complete by 2018, under the government's new remote Indigenous housing strategy?\n\nOf great concern is the redirection of $95 million associated with the existing national partnership agreement to fund reform of the Remote Jobs and Communities Program. Indigenous households are more than three times as likely to be overcrowded. The 2011 ABS census on population and housing reported that around 24,700 Indigenous households were considered to be overcrowded. This equates to 115,600 people, or about one in four Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in overcrowded accommodation. Approximately 60.4 per cent of Aboriginal households in remote parts of the Northern Territory are subject to overcrowding.\n\nThe problems associated with chronic overcrowding in remote communities are well documented. It is concerning that the government has ripped $95 million from the national partnership agreement, given the serious ongoing issues of overcrowding in remote communities. I suppose it should come as no surprise that funding should be ripped away from remote community investment after the Prime Minister described the right of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to live on their traditional lands as a 'lifestyle choice' that should be not be subsidised by taxpayers' money. It follows the decision of this government to cut federal funds for essential and municipal services in remote communities across the country and to hand that responsibility to the states and territories.\n\nParliamentary Secretary, why is the $95 million being cut from the Indigenous remote housing investment? How will reducing funding for remote housing reduce overcrowding in remote communities? Strangely, the new remote housing strategy will fund housing for employment related accommodation not in remote communities but in regional and urban areas\u2014I don't quite get that one. How many houses will actually be constructed in remote communities, as was is intended in the national partnership agreement? And how much of the $1.1 billion for remote housing will now be spent on housing outside of remote communities?","groups":["First Nations","People in regional or remote areas"],"issues":["Shelter"],"date":1434499200000,"id":"eeebcee3-160d-4502-9643-3c58d4a512c1","year":2015,"month":6}

According to a recent independent analysis, AIATSIS holds the most extensive and best-contextualized collection of Indigenous Australia in the world.\n\nThese items come in all manner of media and formats, some of which cannot be replaced. The national collection includes more than 175,680 titles of printed material, 5,000 manuscripts, 2,600 rare books, and 650,000 photographs relating to Indigenous Australia dating from the late 1800s.\n\nIt also includes the Australian Indigenous Languages Collection, which contains over 4,300 titles, and more than 40,000 hours of audio.\n\nThe language collection is of such international significance that it is now part of the UNESCO Australian Memory of the World Register.\n\nAIATSIS is proud that its collection grows at a rate of some 1,400 items per year. Importantly, AIATSIS holds audiovisual recordings of some Indigenous communities and languages which no longer exist.\n\nMaintaining a collection of such breadth, cultural significance and value is not without enormous challenges.\n\nThis bill is part of a reform agenda that will assist AIATSIS to position itself for the future.\n\nIt is an agenda that has been developed through consensus\u2014that recognises the national importance of AIATSIS and acknowledges there must be change to ensure its sustainability.\n\nIn addition, in May this year, the former Minister for Education and Training, the Hon. Christopher Pyne, worked with the AIATSIS council on the establishment of the AIATSIS Foundation. The Governor-General, His Excellency General the Hon. Sir Peter Cosgrove AK MC, launched the foundation.\n\nThe AIATSIS Foundation will make it possible for the broader community and philanthropists to support and contribute to the critical work of AIATSIS.\n\nThis follows steps taken in the 2014\u201315 and 2015\u201316 budgets, when $8.3 million in additional funding was provided over those two years. This was done so that the most immediate risks to the preservation of the national collection of Indigenous cultural materials could be addressed.\n\nThis bill now takes important steps to reform the appointment process for the AIATSIS Council and refocus the functions of AIATSIS towards the purposes it is uniquely placed to achieve.\n\nThis includes that the national collection is maintained as a major research resource and is the largest of its kind in the world.\n\nMore and more of this information is being used by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to reconnect with their culture. It is also increasingly being used to enable cultural revival, including access to lost languages.\n\nThe amendments in the bill reflect the contemporary environment for the heritage and culture of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It affirms AIATSIS' national leadership role in preserving, understanding and communicating this heritage and culture for future generations.\n\nThe bill will refresh the appointment process for the AIATSIS Council.\n\nIn making appointments in the future, consideration will need to be given to the overall skill set of the council so that effective and contemporary governance practices guide the work of AIATSIS. The principle of diversity will be embedded, and importantly so will the requirement to maintain an Indigenous majority on the council.\n\nIn the future, the council will be refreshed on a rolling basis by limiting membership to a maximum of two consecutive terms.\n\nThese changes will provide AIATSIS with a dynamic and strategic council to oversee and guide the activities of the institute into the future.\n\nAIATSIS currently has a wide range of legislated responsibilities which include: promoting, publishing and undertaking relevant research; assisting in training people, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, as research workers in relevant fields; establishing and maintaining a cultural resource collection; and encouraging understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture and heritage.\n\nStreamlining the number of legislated functions that AIATSIS is required to undertake, from eight to five, will better target available resources to ensure that maximum effort is directed towards preserving the national collection.\n\nSince the AIATSIS Act was enacted in 1989, the landscape for preserving, understanding, communicating and developing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture and heritage has changed and grown.\n\nAIATSIS will be better positioned to focus on preserving, maintaining and reviving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge, languages, culture and histories. Also, it will be better positioned to focus on preserving the traditions passed on from one generation to another, now and into the future.\n\nThis bill is an important next step towards ensuring the preservation of this important national collection. I commend the bill to the House.\n\nDebate adjourned.","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Protecting heritage","Diversity"],"date":1447286400000,"id":"c3fe2a34-04af-4eae-b96a-2baece0e0e66","year":2015,"month":11}
{"major_topic":"\nADJOURNMENT ","minor_topic":"\nLearn Earn Legend! Work Exposure in Government, Socceroos ","speaker":"Ed Husic","content":"Yesterday I had the pleasure of meeting Chloe Adler, from Ingham in North Queensland, who is one of the many students taking part in the Learn Earn Legend! Work Exposure in Government. Chloe, a year 12 student, attends Ingham State High School and she has plans after graduation to continue on with a traineeship as a pharmacy assistant in one of the local pharmacies. From this placement at Parliament House, Chloe was hoping to achieve more knowledge about Parliament House and what goes on. She was hoping to see what everyone completes on a daily basis and to view question time as well.\n\nDuring her placement at the Parliament House this week, Chloe had the chance to sit in on a committee meeting and enjoy the nature of question time, like you do, Speaker. She also enjoyed a captivating tour with David Field, from my office, that commenced at my office here in Parliament House and continued through the other parts of this place, as well as gaining an overall knowledge of what my everyday routine consists of. I will be looking forward to a report on that!\n\nThe whole purpose of the LEL WEX program is to reach out to Indigenous senior high school students from across Australia, mainly from remote and rural areas, and to offer them an experience of what it is like working in Parliament House and to show them the forever changing field of government. The main part of this strategy is to close the gap between young Indigenous Australian people, who now have the opportunity to do what they would like to and to try out a career that will set them up for their future and make a change for the better.\n\nBecause of the importance of education and our aims of the Closing the Gap campaign between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in the areas of education, employment and health, this program is a key action that provides a real understanding to our Indigenous students of where a wide-ranging education can take them\u2014in this case, possibly a position in the Public Service.\n\nA number of the students who are in Canberra this week have never stayed in the city before and they have never had the opportunity to visit Parliament House either. So for these students, this is a great experience for them not only to enjoy coming to Canberra and appreciating great architectural buildings but also to get to know other young Indigenous people. That is truly a moment to treasure.\n\nDuring this week the students have been able to see some of the sights and places that Canberra itself has to show, including the Australian Institute of Sport, Ainslie Football Club, the Australian War Memorial and also the National Zoo and Aquarium, and they have got to meet with some inspirational people with a passion for what they do. Chloe said that one of the highlights of her time here in Canberra was visiting the AIS and having a go at all the different sports they have in the building. She also liked the tour around the whole area, in which she and all the other students were shown the training pools, weight rooms and much more. She had never visited New South Wales before and said it was an exciting experience. The spokespeople and participants will share their experiences and journeys from when they were young to where they are now, and their stories will most likely have points that many of the students will relate to. That is an important part for young people these days. These stories have behind them the meaning that dreams can be achieved. Additionally, it is a hope of the program that students will have a series of unforgettable experiences that they can share with their communities when they arrive home. Hopefully, as Chloe says, we can see our program expand with great confidence.\n\nAn extra characteristic of the program is that young students have the opportunity that no ordinary person can have: to gain work experience in a federal government agency. That being said, each of the students were matched with a department or agency which appeared to suit their interests and capabilities that were indicated in their application forms. Chloe will be spending her placement in the Department of Health and Ageing. We are eager to see the program continue and develop, reaching Indigenous students from across the country and promoting their career visions. Hopefully, we will come across some of the students later on, joining us in the public sector to finally increase our Indigenous political representation.\n\nI thank Chloe for writing that terrific speech as well.\n\nIn closing and on another matter, I congratulate the Socceroos, who qualified tonight and got their tickets for Brazil in the 82nd\u2014\n\nMr Laming interjecting\u2014\n\nAnd the Brumbies, yes, but I am particularly pleased to see in the 82nd minute Josh Kennedy score a goal in front of 81,000 fans. The Socceroos will be able to go on to Brazil next year. It is terrific to see them do so well. They have had people doubt whether or not they would be able to proceed, and they certainly put the doubters to shame tonight. It is a great thing to see football progress in this country. We have seen the A-League blossom, and now our national side will go on and do great things in Brazil.","groups":["First Nations","Young people"],"issues":["Negative emotions"],"date":1371513600000,"id":"87943577-f34d-43e9-973b-bdd4972c4f06","year":2013,"month":6}
{"major_topic":"\nQUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE ","minor_topic":"\nBudget ","speaker":"Ken Wyatt","content":"I thank the member for Leichhardt for his ongoing work with Indigenous communities across this nation. Suicide rates from the mid-eighties have doubled in Indigenous communities. What we did during the Darwin and Kimberley roundtables was look at solutions that were community-led and Aboriginal influenced. I involved Christine Morgan in two of those meetings so she had a sense of what Indigenous Australians were saying about the continuity of life and the those suicides happening at a rate that was far too frequent. During the budget process, where we announced $2.3 billion to restructure mental health and tackle suicide, there were some very tangible outcomes for Indigenous programs that would make a difference on the ground. On top of that was the $500 million for the COVID response given what people experienced. Many Indigenous people will access this program as well.\n\nBut the specific ones that are important out of the $79 million include: $27.3 million to implement culturally sensitive co-designed after care\u2014it is important that we address the events and provide the interventions for that impact on families; $23.38 million to support the establishment of regional suicide prevention networks, with the appointment of a commissioning officer in each of those regions to work very closely with Indigenous people, government agencies and NGOs; $16.6 million to Gayaa Dhuwi and Lifeline to establish and evaluate a culturally appropriate 24\/7 lifeline, which is absolutely critical in ensuring that people have a lifeline they can ring in which they get the right information; $6.1 million to secure a national Indigenous leadership program so that our people are equipped with the skills to reduce those impacts and to reduce suicides; $1.5 million to support a review of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health sector delivering mental health services to look at where we can make substantial changes and improvements and engage better to reduce the loss of life; and then $1.1 million to the Black Dog Institute to work very closely with our people to provide avenues in other areas as well. The combination of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous organisations and Commonwealth and state government agencies has been an exemplary process in both those suicide roundtables, where people have come together, have shared knowledge, data, information and resources, and redesigned the way in which they provide support to those contemplating or affected by suicide.","groups":["First Nations","LGBTIQ+","People with chronic health conditions"],"issues":["Health care\/Health","Finance"],"date":1621900800000,"id":"d5982e2f-0692-4d9f-a9f2-a8f952384369","year":2021,"month":5}

{"major_topic":"\nADJOURNMENT ","minor_topic":"\nBurrup Peninsula ","speaker":"Melissa Parke","content":"In November last year I had the pleasure of visiting the Burrup Peninsula\u2014 or Murujuga in the Indigenous language\u2014in the Dampier Archipelago of the Pilbara region of Western Australia. I wish to place on the record my deep thanks to Dr Ken Mulvaney, an archaeologist and anthropologist with Rio Tinto in Dampier, who acted as guide for the day and who probably knows more about the rock art than anyone else on the planet. I have to say that his passion and care for this incredible cultural heritage was highly infectious.\n\nThe Dampier rock art precinct, located in a 45 km radius, is estimated to contain more than a million Aboriginal rock art engravings, also known as petroglyphs, but only a fraction of them have been recorded. The oldest rock art on the Burrup is estimated to be up to 35,000 years old and depicts geometric designs, as well as images of humans, birds, fish and animals, including thylacines or Tasmanian tigers, which have been extinct on the mainland for over 3,000 years. The art is extensive, appearing on most rocky outcrops on the peninsula. Located near much of the art are archaeological features, including shell middens, camp sites and quarries, the total comprising a rich record reflecting the lifestyles, beliefs and ceremonial practices of Aboriginal people in the Pilbara area over millennia.\n\nAs long-time advocate for the rock art, the Hon. Robin Chapple MLC, has noted:\n\nThis may well be the world's largest concentration of rock art and possibly the only site that provides distinct evidence of the changes to environment, culture and society over such an extended period.\n\nThe National Trust of Australia (WA) has described the rock art precinct as 'one of the world's pre-eminent sites of recorded human evolution and a prehistoric university'. In 2003, the World Monuments Fund added it to its list of most endangered places\u2014the first time an Australian place had been included. In 2005, concerned citizens formed the Friends of Australian Rock Art, FARA, to raise awareness of the Burrup Peninsula's unique heritage and to campaign for its protection. In July 2007, the Dampier Archipelago National Heritage Place, which includes 68.4 per cent of the Burrup Peninsula, was inscribed in the National Heritage List.\n\nThese wonders are unfortunately largely unknown to the wider WA and Australian community, and have been poorly protected by past and present governments. Dr Carmen Lawrence, Chair of the Australian Heritage Council and my predecessor as the federal member for Fremantle, recently published an article on the pressing need for action by state and federal governments to protect the Burrup rock art from industrial development and pollution. She eloquently explains the situation as follows:\n\nIt should be obvious that such a site is a precious part of our heritage, of the world's heritage, deserving of careful study and preservation.\n\nBut instead of the care and reverence which we would expect to be shown to a site with the significance of Stonehenge, the painted caves of Lascaux in France or the structures of Machu Picchu, the rock art precinct on the Burrup has taken second place to industrial and resource development for more than 40 years.\n\nAlthough there have been a number of partial surveys of this matchless site, many of them undertaken as part of the development approval process, it has never been the subject of a comprehensive inventory or analysis.\n\n\u2026 \u2026 \u2026\n\nSince the decision by Malcolm Turnbull in 2007 to place the site on the National Heritage List (excluding the area set aside for the Pluto LNG expansion), the Western Australian Government has still not completed the management plan for which it is responsible.\n\nIn the meantime, industrial expansion proceeds: proposals for two nitrate facilities and a desalination plant are under consideration. Vandalism is occurring and the few tourist visits are haphazard and unsupervised.\n\nThis is an unacceptable situation. I note that when the Hon. Colin Barnett MLA was in state opposition, he said this in parliament:\n\nWorld heritage listing [of the Archipelago] is inevitable \u2026 The status of the rock art [makes it] in my opinion without doubt the most important heritage site in WA and possibly the nation \u2026 We certainly cannot use ignorance today as an excuse. If there is one part of Western Australia where this conflict between conservation and development is most apparent it is on the Burrup Peninsula.\n\nDisappointingly, those sentiments have not to my knowledge been repeated by Mr Barnett since becoming Premier and, indeed, an ammonium nitrate facility on the Burrup has been recommended by the WA EPA for approval. The federal environment minister has requested that the Australian Heritage Council conduct an emergency heritage assessment of the Burrup and that is now underway.\n\nWe cannot have a situation in Australia where we proudly refer to our Indigenous heritage as representing the oldest unbroken course of human civilisation, while at the same time ignoring the need to protect the enduring examples of that culture and that extraordinary record.\n\nIn the words of Dr Carmen Lawrence:\n\nKnowledge and experience of our heritage gives meaning to our lives, inspires us and contributes to our collective sense of identity. The sites, landscapes and places which we can be galvanised to protect are, in some ways, an indication of what matters to us and what we think of ourselves.","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Protecting heritage","Inclusion\/Exclusion"],"date":1329264000000,"id":"15b376f3-10ab-41e3-b6f3-c908eb6d7732","year":2012,"month":2}
{"major_topic":"\nCONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS ","minor_topic":"\nNaltrexone ","speaker":"Dennis Geoffrey Jensen","content":"I wish to raise the issue of Dr George O\u2019Neil\u2019s Naltrexone clinic and the dire need there is for urgent funding approval by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. As I mentioned in May this year, Dr O\u2019Neil\u2019s clinic does a magnificent job in producing implants, administering them and providing the vital follow-up services to help drug addicts and alcoholics reform their whole lives and become functioning members of society.\n\nThe Minister for Health and Ageing has provided information on the current level of federal funding, which is about three- quarters of a million dollars. However, Dr O\u2019Neil estimates that it costs $2 million to $3 million a year to produce the implants and treat the patients who come to his clinic not just from around Western Australia but from all over the country. Therefore, while the current federal funding is welcome it does not come anywhere near the true cost which Dr O\u2019Neil and his staff have been underwriting for some years. But this much dedication to improving the lives of others does have its limits. Obviously, the approval of the TGA for the treatment is vital and hopefully will be achieved shortly. However, more funding is essential.\n\nAccording to the government\u2019s first hundred days orgy of self-congratulation, the government announced $50 million in funding to each state and territory to provide additional drug and alcohol rehabilitation services to Indigenous communities. Given that many programs have not had the tremendous success rate that Dr O\u2019Neil has, perhaps the money would be better used replicating Dr O\u2019Neil\u2019s programs. The Indigenous communities could shake off the scourge of substance abuse, the root cause of so many Indigenous problems, and the wider community would have better access to treatment as well. My challenge to the government is to stop thinking like process driven bureaucrats and look at the big picture. Here is a program which is successful, economically responsible and so, given the massive burden of substance abuse to our society, I say: \u2018Bite the bullet, Prime Minister. Ensure the program gets the TGA\u2019s seal of approval as soon as possible. Let us save more lives, save more families and communities, save more money from fewer crimes, fewer insurance claims and fewer demands on our health services, especially mental health. Show true leadership and put our money where it is shown it can do the most good.\u2019","groups":["First Nations","People with chronic health conditions","People with drug problems"],"issues":["Violence","Crime\/criminal justice","Addiction","Prejudice and discrimination"],"date":1226534400000,"id":"10366120-4846-4622-9f16-8d4e1d7389af","year":2008,"month":11}
{"major_topic":"\nADJOURNMENT ","minor_topic":"\nO'Connor Electorate: Health Services ","speaker":"Rick Wilson","content":"Today I rise to report that on 16 July the federal health minister, the Hon. Sussan Ley, made a flying visit to the Goldfields-Esperance area to meet with local health professionals to discuss difficulties encountered delivering health services in regional and remote areas. The day started in Kalgoorlie with a visit to the Royal Flying Doctor Service to tour their impressive facility and to announce a grant of $2.5 million to support the purchase of a Pilatus PC-12 aircraft to service the Aboriginal communities and more remote areas of my electorate of O'Connor. Minister Ley also discussed the $20 million in increased funding to the RFDS announced in this year's budget. This additional funding will take the Commonwealth government's contribution to the RFDS to $68 million per annum for the financial years 2015-16 and 2016-17. This increased capacity also ties in with a campaign I am spearheading to expand the Norseman Airport capacity to an all-weather strip to allow the RFDS to access the strategic three-way junction between Highway 1 crossing the Nullarbor and the Goldfields-Esperance Highway on any given day of the year.\n\nAnother great initiative we shared with Minister Ley was the telehealth facility at the Kalgoorlie Hospital, where we participated in a real-time consultation with Leonora doctor Leo Winslow. WA Country Health Service recently completed a successful pilot trial of telehealth delivery, which proved of considerable value when the Laverton Hospital was without a doctor. Telehealth currently allows for emergency and 11 different specialist consultations from remote outposts. Minster Ley showed great interest in the current delivery of telehealth and is excited about the prospects for future delivery of a greater suite of services through this technology. This year's budget added an MBS item for telehealth and ophthalmology services in regional Australia, and the current MBS review will look at removing outdated services and replacing them with innovative services like telehealth going forward.\n\nWe also took the opportunity to visit the dialysis ward and inspected some of the new seven new chairs funded by this Commonwealth government. It was great to see the patients so comfortable while being cared for by the wonderful staff on this ward. Given that many of the patients are Indigenous and most have travelled from the Ngaanyatjarra lands to receive treatment three days per week, it is very exciting to hear that a 19-bed hostel on Brown Avenue is ready to begin construction\u2014once again, funded by the Commonwealth government.\n\nWhile on the Kalgoorlie Health Campus, the minister and I hosted a roundtable discussion with health professionals from across the Goldfields at the Rural Clinical School. This was a great opportunity for Minister Ley to hear about the unique challenges faced by health service providers who work in remote and very remote communities. This is a summary of some of the people who attended the roundtable and some of their contributions: pharmacist John Coufos\u2014and I thank John for making the trip down from Leonora\u2014and Kalgoorlie pharmacists Brooke and Oliver Dziubak.\n\nThe pharmacists in general were very happy with pharmacy agreement No. 6, but in relation to Goldfields there was some concern over the delivery of the S100 drug and medicine mechanism for Aboriginal communities. Paediatrician Christine Jeffries-Stokes raised the issue of Indigenous young people not getting access to good health services and she raised, very strongly, her opposition to the state government's proposal to close down remote communities. Primary Health Network CEO, Andy Barnes, was there to reassure that health providers across Goldfields were transitioned into the new Primary Health Networks from the old Medicare Locals. Manager of Goldfields Rehabilitation Services, Jane Fajardo, highlighted the lack of rehab facilities and detox facilities across Goldfields, particularly for people addicted to ice. Kylie Sterry, who is an obstetrician GP and principal at Plaza Medical Service and also lectures at the Rural Clinical School, provided us with her amazing range of expertise across the board. I thank the minister for the time that she took to sit down with local health providers to brainstorm innovative ways forward for O'Connor.\n\nAfter the visit to Kalgoorlie we made a very quick trip to Esperance where we met with half a dozen GPs. Their issue primarily revolved around providing internship places in regional areas, particularly in towns like Esperance, so that young GPs can receive training in situ in regional areas.\n\nNext week I will have the pleasure of representing the minister in Kalgoorlie to open the newly refurbished block 1 at the Kalgoorlie Health Campus. This block is being completed as part of a $55.8 million redevelopment of the Kalgoorlie Health Campus, including $15.8 million funding from the Western Australian government. It houses outpatients, allied health, patient assisted travel schemes and a $3.8 million Commonwealth funded cancer centre.","groups":["First Nations","Young people","People in regional or remote areas"],"issues":["Addiction","Finance","Prejudice and discrimination"],"date":1440028800000,"id":"6c6ea5a8-d9b9-4213-bd31-0e5e85f6cb33","year":2015,"month":8}

{"major_topic":"\nCONDOLENCES ","minor_topic":"\nRose, Mr Lionel Edward, MBE ","speaker":"John Alexander","content":"I rise to speak on the sad and premature passing of one of our greatest ever sporting legends. It is rather difficult to do this after my friends the member for Hasluck and the member for Bass so vividly demonstrated what Lionel Rose did for our generation in bringing us together. He was born and raised in Jacksons Track, south-east of Melbourne, one of the few remaining untouched Aboriginal communities at the time. Lionel grew up in the most difficult of circumstances. He learned to box from his father, Roy, who was an amateur fighter. Initially, when he could not afford gloves, he wrapped his hands in rags and he boxed in a ring made of fencing wire stretched between trees. There was no such thing as rope-a-dope for Lionel. He was given his first gloves at the age of 10 by a press photographer.\n\nLionel commenced organised training at the age of 15 under a local trainer, Frank Oakes; Lionel would later marry his daughter Jenny. Soon after, he won the Australian amateur flyweight title. He turned professional in 1964 after missing out on selection for the 1964 Olympic Games. He moved to Melbourne and lived with Jack and Shirley Rennie. Jack became his trainer and they worked out every day in their backyard gym. Interestingly, Harry Hopman was a great friend of Jack Rennie and a great fan of boxing. He took two young Australian tennis players who were living and training with him at the time to see Lionel do his farewell spar before he went to Los Angeles to defend his title: Phil Dent and I got to meet Lionel at that time. We were so impressed with his gentleness and with his incredible modesty. He was already a world champion at 19.\n\nHe built up a flawless record in Australia and New Zealand, leading to winning the Australian bantamweight title in October 1966. He continued to win belts, including a famous knockout win against Rocky Gattellari at Sydney Stadium. He then challenged the legendary national hero Fighting Harada for the world bantamweight title on 26 February 1968 in Tokyo. He was an enormous underdog; he was said to be too young to fight at this level. He made history by becoming the first Aboriginal Australian to win a world championship. He defeated Harada in 15 gruelling rounds.\n\nThis win made Rose an instant national hero and an icon among Aboriginal Australians. He was welcomed back to Melbourne by 250,000 fans to celebrate his great success. Rose defended his title again in Tokyo and in California, where the disappointed local crowds started a riot; the referee needed hospitalisation and over a dozen spectators were also treated. He retired in 1971, with a brief but unsuccessful comeback attempt in 1975.\n\nLionel Rose became the first Indigenous Australian to be awarded Australian of the Year in 1968, the same year he was awarded an MBE. In 2003, he was an inaugural inductee into the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame. He was featured on an Australia Post stamp two years later and also awarded the Ella Lifetime Achievement Award for contribution to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sport. Lionel went on to have a musical career. In 1970 he released two hit ballads: \n\nAfter retiring from boxing Lionel remained an inspiration for Indigenous Australians. In 1996 Lionel gave his world title belt to a six-year-old Indigenous boy, Tjandamurra O'Shane, who was the innocent victim of a horrific schoolyard attack, suffering burns to 70 per cent of his body. Lionel hoped the belt would give O'Shane hope for a speedy recovery. In 2008 O'Shane completed year 12 and graduated from Woree State High School, providing a great joy for Lionel, who had suffered a stroke earlier that year.\n\nAn award-winning film of his life, a documentary called \n\nLionel Rose was an inspiration to his people, many of whom experience great hopelessness in white society. Lionel showed that anything is possible, that a poor young Indigenous boy could rise to be a world champion and become a national hero. It is a beautiful irony that, on the same day that Lionel passed, Daniel Geale, another young Australian with Indigenous heritage, won the IBF middleweight championship in Germany, becoming only the fourth Australian born boxer to win a title on foreign soil.\n\nLegendary trainer Johnny Lewis said:\n\nI think Lionel Rose showed indigenous Australians that they could achieve anything if they worked hard, but he was an inspiration for all Australians.\n\nEven current boxing champion Anthony Mundine, one not normally renowned for sharing the limelight, described Lionel Rose as the best Australian fighter ever. Lionel also became a symbol of the political discourse of the time, as debate on racial equality and Indigenous rights was the defining issue of the day. He turned professional the same year as the Freedom Ride and won his world title one year after the 1967 referendum.\n\nIt is interesting that Lionel found his fame in the manly art of self-defence, yet he displayed the most extraordinary level of gentleness. I grew up with a girl called Evonne Goolagong. Evonne showed the same extraordinary gentleness, as did Cathy Freeman later on. All three shared an incredible physical grace.

{"major_topic":"\nPRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS ","minor_topic":"\nIndigenous Affairs ","speaker":"Ken Wyatt","content":"I thank the member for Makin for his motion. In discussions I have had with Premier Barnett; Minister Collier, the Western Australian Aboriginal affairs minister; Minister Helen Morton, the Western Australian Minister for Mental Health; and Terry Redman, the minister for regional Western Australia, all four have given me a strong commitment that there will be no closure of Aboriginal communities. There will be no closure without consultation. What they have raised with me is the concerns that I have seen over my lifetime: access to services, facilities and career pathways for children. Even when I was involved in many of the early reports that were tabled in either state or Commonwealth parliaments, the message consistently was: 'We will choose to live in certain areas, but we also accept that there are areas where governments cannot provide funding. It is our choice.' That choice is important.\n\nBut what I have found since the Hawke government is that there has been a decline in the practice of consulting on the ground and talking about what is needed. In fact, when I was in Health I worked with Shane Houston to develop a measure in Health that looked at community functioning. It was designed to be a tool that would enable Commonwealth and state agencies to go into a community and look at the programs and services that were being provided. This came off the back of my thinking in respect of an earlier inquiry by the Commonwealth Grants Commission on Indigenous expenditure and a couple of very salient points they made. They said\u2014they made this point quite strongly\u2014that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander funding was supplementary to mainstream government services. They went on to say that government agencies at both the state and federal levels relied on Aboriginal budgets to provide services to communities and to organisations, instead of saying, 'They are citizens of Australia; they are entitled to have access to funding.'\n\nI have always found in agencies that, when you are planning, they say, 'What's in the Aboriginal bucket?' When I was in Health, I asked the then secretary of the department what was the representation of the Aboriginal dollars in Aboriginal health against the total health budget. I asked for a pie chart to be shown to us. That slice of the pie chart, when you considered the total Commonwealth budget for health, was as thin as a strand of somebody's hair. It was insufficient. Yet people should be accessing the range of government services. We should not talk about mainstream services; they are government services to all citizens.\n\nI know that my four parliamentary colleagues in Western Australia are considering that issue in the context of the planning that they have in mind for the engagement with Aboriginal leaders within each of those communities, and they have given a genuine undertaking. Terry Redman, when he met with me in my office, talked about an orbit community around a central hub and how they could provide and look at job opportunities in the future. He was certainly looking at agriculture, particularly in the Pilbara and in the Kimberley, given the northern Australian strategy as a way of proceeding. But it was also the intent of CDEP and many other training programs to train people in particular skills that would give them pathways into jobs that any other Australian could walk into. Instead, what we saw was that those programs became enmeshed in, as Noel Pearson says, sitting down for the dole. The training that was supposed to come did not happen. Had it happened, communities would then have been better positioned to take care of their infrastructure. There would have been jobs.\n\nThe intent of programs and services has significant merit, but I find it fascinating when I walk into an organisation and I am being told that they meet their KPIs yet, when I get permission to walk through a community, I do not see the change that is supposed to have happened. I think all successive governments, including future ones, need to look at outcomes on the ground so that education, employment and health become the priorities and we give people choices as to where they live. But if they choose to live in a family context on country then there must also be the reciprocal understanding that they then access a hub within the orbit arrangement.\n\nThere is hope and opportunity, but I think that all members of this parliament have to set aside their positions and work collectively to achieve the changes that we need to make a difference for the next decade, because if we do not then nothing will be achieved.\n\nDebate adjourned.\n\nSitting suspended from 13:44 to 16:00","groups":["First Nations","People with chronic health conditions"],"issues":["Finance"],"date":1432512000000,"id":"51b3abf8-8c9f-46a4-ac34-d9c0faea99e8","year":2015,"month":5}
{"major_topic":"\nBILLS ","minor_topic":"\nAppropriation Bill (No. 1) 2020-2021; Consideration in Detail ","speaker":"Terri Butler","content":"It's interesting that the minister talks about 'a wheelbarrow full of reports', because, of course, one of the people who's been writing reports on the basin has said of this set of communities that they feel like they've been overconsulted but under-listened-to. That is a real theme that comes out when you talk to people in the basin. They feel like there have been a lot of wheels turning in attempts to consult them, but there has been very little action, there are very few outcomes, and there hasn't really been enough listening\u2014or, at least, they're not being heard. There has been review after review, but there hasn't been enough action yet. I want to talk about that, but let me start by agreeing with the minister and saying, 'Yes, Minister, I am very interested in compliance in the basin, and I'm not the only one.' One of the reasons I'm so interested in compliance is that trust and confidence are central to communities in the basin being able to not just survive but thrive. They need to know that they're getting a fair go. That's what farmers want, that's what traditional owners want, it's what communities want, and it's what environmentalists want. They want a fair go. Part of that fair go is trust and confidence. This is important.\n\nThe Basin Plan is a $13 billion plan, and the value of agricultural production in the basin is $24 billion annually. It is massively important, not just to the communities in the basin\u2014although, that is, of course, a very wide geographical area\u2014but to the entire nation, so we need to make sure that we have a government that understands what needs to be done. But this government has no plan for water security for our nation and has been quite woeful at handling the many criticisms that have been expressed about the way that the Murray-Darling Basin has been governed and how the plan has been implemented. There is, of course, their traditional approach of saying one thing in the regions and then doing something else in Canberra. With that as the context, let me talk about compliance. Let me talk about trust and confidence.\n\nThe minister mentioned Robbie Sefton's report, \n\nWe found many people have diminished trust in federal and state governments to deliver good long term policy and support rural and regional Basin communities. People in Basin communities repeatedly said they had lost trust because they feel over-consulted and under-listened to. We heard strong messages that successive governments have hollowed out their local and regional capability and knowledge and have not provided clear leadership or a compelling vision.\n\nShe also said, in making recommendations about how to improve the way that we all work together:\n\nGovernments and Basin communities need to work together to rebuild trust, and communities need to be put at the centre of conversations about their future.\n\nThis wasn't new. The Productivity Commission in 2018 had spoken of the legacy of community distrust and warned that if things didn't improve then trust and confidence would be reduced further. Infrastructure Australia has acknowledged the impact of the Menindee fish kill and other events in undermining confidence in the government's management of water. And, of course, Mr Keelty, who I join with the minister in thanking for his work in his time as inspector-general, said:\n\nIn the absence of strong, basin-wide leadership, there is a perception that some parties are too busy 'playing politics' and are ineffectual at making any tough decisions, especially when it comes to making decisions in the national interest and at the whole-of-basin level.\n\nSo a range of concerns have been raised by reviewers, by the Productivity Commission and by the inspector-general.\n\nMinister, that is why we are so interested in compliance\u2014because it goes to the question of trust and confidence, and those things go to the question of the quality of life of the people who live in the basin, and the quality of life for our entire nation, because of the significance of agriculture and water to it. So that's why we're interested.\n\nYour predecessor as minister, back in August last year, announced the creation of an inspector-general position for the Murray-Darling Basin., and we welcomed it at the time. In a press release, the government said, 'This Inspector-General will be able to refer issues of concern off to the Commonwealth integrity commission.' There's only one problem with that: the inspector-general has come and gone and still no Commonwealth integrity commission has actually been established. So that never happened.\n\nBut what also never happened was a range of things that had meant to be occurring with the inspector-general. It was meant to be interim, for a short time, and then a statutory basis for the inspector general position with statutory powers. It never happened. Then, a year later, the government abolished the position. They say, 'We'll have a new position.' That's great, but\u2014guess what\u2014it's not going to be stood up until September 2021. So there will be a year gap in compliance. And, of course, as has been said by the minister, Mick Keelty did not continue. There is no current interim inspector-general. There is no compliance entity of this type that was sold to Australians with so much fanfare back in August last year. It's was just another photo op with no follow-up.","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Negative emotions","Finance"],"date":1605139200000,"id":"d3234e41-738b-45e1-b6e6-6e5b0857fa33","year":2020,"month":11}
{"major_topic":"\nMOTIONS ","minor_topic":"\nDomestic and Family Violence ","speaker":"Sharon Leah Bird","content":"I appreciate the opportunity to make a few comments in this debate today. It is the case that a year ago, almost exactly to the day, I was standing in this same place talking about White Ribbon Day. On that occasion, I was reflecting on 40 years previously\u2014that is, 1975\u2014which was International Women's Year\u2014and the events that I remember happening when I was much younger woman than I am now, such as when my mum and a group of women in our local community decided to establish a women's refuge in the area. Great work was done by the public school mother's group, who were the driving force behind that. They were supported by the local council, a group of nuns from Warrawong, local unions and some businesses who provided equipment and paint and so forth. They established the first women's refuge in our area. I am fairly sure that those women then, and my young self at the time, would have hoped that 41 years later\u2013if they could have imagined that I would end up in this place representing the community\u2014it would not be an issue that we had to keep talking about. But we do, and that is why I want to again say how important this issue is, and we can hope that in another 40 years, our successors in this place will not have to have these conversations. Each and every one of us are working towards making that future a reality, in whatever way we can with whatever power we have.\n\nThere have been some amazing contributions across the parliament on this and I want to acknowledge my colleague Emma Husar and her powerful, personal testimony. It brought home to many of us the far-reaching affects that family and domestic violence has on people's lives. It is sadly the case that it permeates throughout families. You clearly have those who are the direct victims of this sort of behaviour, most often women and too often children\u2014and often men too. I think it is important that we have acknowledged that there is an issue with violence being perpetrated against men; though it is predominantly women and children who are the target. But it affects the whole family and that is the reality. That terrible abuse and disrespect of each other plays out through the whole family.\n\nI was at a forum on the weekend where we talked about homelessness. Many teenagers, boys and girls, are homeless because they are fleeing violence within the home. The world is a tough place. The one place where you should be able to go to and feel supported, loved and safe is your home. The fact is that too many people do not have that as their day-to-day experience and that is something that should never, ever walk away from taking action on. Whether that is supporting health services, legal services, programs and housing for those who find themselves homeless, the actions of governments can make a great difference. But at the end of the day, it is actions that we take as individuals that are so important. I am a mother of two sons. It is important that we raise the next generation to have respect not only for each other but for themselves. Too much disrespect for others comes from a lack of respect for yourself.\n\nWe need to raise a generation who understand that you are strong and powerful because you are respectful, because you are confident in yourself and you do not have to take that power from someone else to be powerful. These are very strong messages to raise our children and nieces and nephews with. I do sometimes worry about the pop culture view that comes through to young women that looks are everything, that popularity is everything\u2014putting a picture on Facebook and seeing how many people like you then determines how good your day is. I do worry that some of that increasing trend is not giving the young women of today a strength within themselves, a strength to value themselves for who they are. We need to have these conversations.\n\nThe activities of community groups in particular are important here. We have a great Reclaim the Night group in Wollongong. I went to their rally in October in the mall. They have been working and gathering petitions on actions we can take. And there are the activities of many groups in this parliament. On Monday morning, as the member for Lingiari reported, we participated in a wonderful cultural event by the Indigenous community about saying no to violence. These are all important things. We need to do them as groups and communities and a society, and we also need to individually ensure that we are giving to the next generation strong and powerful messages of restraint, dignity and care and concern for each other that we can hope plant the seed, so that in 40 years time this is not a conversation that we will need to continue having. I commend both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition's statements on this and I add my voice to that call.\n\nDebate adjourned.","groups":["First Nations","Migrants and refugees","Homeless people"],"issues":["Shelter","Violence","Crime\/criminal justice"],"date":1480464000000,"id":"733f27ca-6e18-4ede-ab63-3054ee44637d","year":2016,"month":11}
{"major_topic":"\nADJOURNMENT ","minor_topic":"\nNational Partnership on Remote Housing ","speaker":"Milton Dick","content":"Adequate, safe and secure housing is critical to every facet of life for every Australian, but for many of our First Australians, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders living in remote communities, housing is anything but adequate, safe or secure. Next Monday the Prime Minister will stand up to deliver his annual response to the \n\nFor the past 10 years, the Commonwealth government has worked in partnership with state governments to build houses in these remote communities, many of which are in my home state of Queensland. The National Partnership on Remote Housing has been a remarkably successful program which includes among its many achievements reducing overcrowding in Queensland's remote communities by half. This is not simply a housing program. It is a skills, training and employment program, and it's a program that works.\n\nSince the program's commencement in 2008, Queensland has delivered 1,150 new homes and delivered 2,640 jobs, and more than 80 per cent of those jobs are performed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workers. Right now, in remote communities in Queensland, there are 515 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people employed in housing construction through the national partnership. Ninety-six of these workers are trade apprentices who are learning skills that will take them into long-term careers as builders, electricians and plumbers. This is exactly the sort of outcome we need to close the gap. In fact, this is exactly the kind of outcome we need to lift people out of welfare across the board. The difference this program has made in these communities is concrete, tangible and measurable.\n\nEarlier today in Canberra, it was a pleasure to meet with several of the delegates and mayors of these communities who have been here this week to speak to the government, members of the opposition and the crossbench, not just to impress upon them the importance of continuing this program but also to set the record straight\u2014because the record needs to be set straight.\n\nYesterday during question time, the Minister for Indigenous Health stood up in this parliament and said the states would have to commit to an equal partnership with the Commonwealth and put money on the table. Well, Queensland has put money on the table and will continue to put money on the table because, unlike the Prime Minister, the Queensland state government is not walking away from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders living in remote communities.\n\nThe truth is that the National Partnership on Remote Housing does not require a capital contribution from the states. However, over the past 10 years, the Queensland government has gone above this and contributed more than $650 million towards remote Indigenous housing, including in the communities of Cherbourg and Yarrabah, which the Commonwealth refuses to include in the partnership agreement. Of the 1,150 homes built in Queensland, 199 have been built with Queensland money. Queensland has committed to the ongoing maintenance, upgrade and depreciation costs of these homes, along with the training costs associated with the training of the apprentices who actually build these homes.\n\nThere is a young man visiting us in Canberra today, His name is Lenny. He's 23 years old, and he lives with his mother and grandmother in the remote community of Hope Vale, in Far North Queensland, almost 3,000 kilometres from where we sit today. Through the national partnership agreement, Lenny became an apprentice, building homes in his own community. Lenny finished his apprenticeship just a few weeks ago. He's now a fully qualified carpenter earning a steady wage building homes in Hope Vale. His mother currently has a job in Cooktown, but that job will finish up soon, meaning that Lenny will be the sole breadwinner for his family. If the Prime Minister continues with his plan to cut the National Partnership on Remote Housing, Lenny, like many other Indigenous Australians, will be out of a job.\n\nThe Commonwealth government commissioned a review into the National Partnership on Remote Housing, which was released in December last year\u2014not by any state government but by the Commonwealth government. That report clearly outlines that Queensland has met and exceeded set benchmarks and recommends continuing the partnership to further progress closing the gap. It even says that housing should be measured as a Closing the Gap benchmark. And what have we heard about the report from those opposite? Nothing.\n\nI say this to the Prime Minister: on Monday, do not come in here and deliver a ","groups":["First Nations","People on welfare","People in regional or remote areas"],"issues":["Shelter","Work","Government assistance","Finance"],"date":1517961600000,"id":"c3cf7f3d-adbc-49bb-be91-2cd97ea78491","year":2018,"month":2}

Indigenous Australians deserve to be able to live in similar conditions to the rest of us, and that is absolutely crucial. I am keen, and I know the minister is keen, to see state and territory governments improve the construction and management of public housing in remote communities. There is no doubt that that improvement is necessary. The current investment in remote housing will achieve 11,500 more livable homes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by mid-2018, so that is a very important initiative, and 75 per cent of the existing stock has been improved.

This bill addresses a further area of concern expressed by Aboriginal people in the \n\nA casual reader of this second reading speech would think that this bill goes further than the legislation introduced into the parliament by the former government last year. In fact, this bill very significantly waters down the legislation introduced last year. The legislation introduced last year totally banned all pornographic material in the prescribed areas, including pay TV porn. This bill effectively allows pay TV porn. In fact, it overturns the former government\u2019s restrictions on pay TV porn.\n\nLet us return for a moment to the \n\nUnfortunately, this legislation puts a Clayton\u2019s ban on pay TV porn, because pay TV porn will only be banned under this legislation if the community asks for a ban, if the minister thinks that a ban is in the public interest and if the pay TV porn channel comprises at least 35 per cent pornographic material.\n\nThere is another issue with this bill\u2014and the office of the Leader of the Opposition has been pursuing this with the minister in question. It is a drafting issue\u2014that is, whether the 35 per cent provision in this bill applies to a specific channel or to the entire service. If it applies to a specific channel then there is little doubt that pay TV porn channels would, at least, potentially be coverable by this legislation. But, if it applies to the entire service, no existing pay TV porn channel would in fact be covered by this legislation. So the legislation would be completely useless, as opposed to being merely utterly ineffective, in banning pay TV porn from these areas.\n\nAs I said at the beginning of my remarks yesterday, I believe that the government is sincere, notwithstanding the stated opposition of some of its members. I think the government at senior levels is sincere in wanting the intervention to work and in wanting to continue to prosecute the intervention. But this legislation is not the way to do it.\n\nI now wish to return to the question of permits, given a recent development in this area. According to the minister\u2019s second reading speech, once the bill is passed the government will \u2018by means of a ministerial determination ensure that journalists can access communities for the purpose of reporting on events in communities\u2019. In other words, under the restored permit system that the government is currently proposing, no journalist will be able to visit a remote Northern Territory township without an express ministerial permit.\n\nI ask members opposite: do they really think it is acceptable to ban the media from wide swathes of our country, except on the issue of a ministerial permit? If a riot breaks out in, Wadeye, Port Keats, for instance, should coverage of those events be dependent upon the issuing of a ministerial permit? Even if the minister in question is totally committed to free speech and utterly committed to the widest possible journalistic access to what is happening in our country, what if the minister is out of the country? What if the minister is tied up with other matters? As we know, when events happen the media have to be there as quickly as possible. And, even though ministerial permits are to be given automatically, the fact is that the requirement for them means that there will be, in effect, a news blackout in these remote townships and that is just unacceptable.\n\nI noted this morning in the \n\n\u2026situational, and attempts to take into account the particular cultural sensitivities presented when operating on Aboriginal land.\n\nI know that Australian journalists are not the most sensitive of people. I know that sometimes they can go blundering\u2014and they are a little bit like Australian politicians in that respect\u2014but the fact is we have got to let them in. If our democracy is going to survive, we have got to let the media know what is happening because, I say in this chamber, evil thrives in darkness.

If the government would like to talk to the opposition about a better way to of doing what the opposition has proposed then I would welcome that. If the government would like to take the amendments on notice and consider them in the Senate, I would be prepared to accept that. But what I will not accept, speaking on behalf of the opposition, is an unamended bill because, while the bill does reflect a government which wants to do the right thing, it does not actually do the right thing. In the end, it is the job of an opposition not to say \u2018me too\u2019 to whatever a government proposes but to be constructive and, where necessary, to point out the flaws in what the government is doing.

Today the WP Holman Clinic, established in 1952, and renamed after Dr Holman in 1986, is the leading provider of treatment for cancer patients in Northern Tasmania.\n\nThe clinic has been expanding at an average rate of around 10 per cent per year for the last six years, with almost 2,000 patients attending the clinic annually. Supporting the clinic and its ability to deliver top-line treatment to the patients that enter its doors every year has been a focus of both this government and the Tasmanian Liberal government. This joint commitment and partnership led to the delivery of a new state-of-the-art CT scanner and linear accelerator to the clinic last year, as part of a $28 million upgrade to our state's ageing oncology equipment, through the Commonwealth Radiation Oncology Health Program. Its investment in the best equipment, combined with access to the most advanced treatment, has led to an increase in cancer survival rates, which is an incredible outcome. In 2019 it was reported that almost seven out of 10 Australians will survive at least five years beyond a cancer diagnosis, and, between 2011 and 2015, relative survival for all cancers combined was 69 per cent, up from just 50 per cent between 1986 and 1990.\n\nThere wouldn't be many of us who have remained untouched by cancer in some way. I lost my own father when I was just eight years old. He passed away within a matter of weeks at the age of just 42.\n\nTo see the survivor statistics is extraordinary, but there does need to be a focus on assisting cancer survivors to live well post treatment. Over the past 12 months, I've had a number of conversations with compassionate and dedicated staff at the clinic about the topic of survivorship and exactly what's needed to provide the right care for those who have survived a cancer diagnosis. Annually over 3,500 Tasmanians receive a diagnosis of cancer, and over two-thirds of them are likely to experience one or more survivorship care needs, which, as pointed out by Holman clinic staff, needs to go beyond disease surveillance by oncologists and surgeons.\n\nI think our society, to a degree, expects survivors of cancer to be thankful that they're alive and that life should resume as it was before their diagnosis and treatment. Yet research has indicated that following cancer treatment many cancer patients and their families describe a void of care, information, knowledge and support, regardless of their geographical location. It's important to point out that people in low socioeconomic groups, rural and remote areas and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have poorer cancer outcomes and access to comprehensive cancer services, including survivorship care. Regardless of background, after the shock of a diagnosis, the physical, emotional, mental and financial trauma a cancer patient endures can be tremendous, and the expectation that they will just pick up life where they left off is unreasonable and detrimental to leading a more meaningful life post cancer. Research undertaken by the clinic has identified these gaps and pain points, with one cancer survivor stating, 'Everyone was so helpful during treatment, but afterwards there wasn't really anyone to call,' while others, when discussing life after treatment and their recurrent fear, have said, 'I'm still not right almost a year later, and you always think about it coming back.'\n\nThe Holman clinic is leading the way in advocating for cancer survivorship services that support patients, their families and the broader community to live healthy, well-informed and meaningful lives. Led by clinical nurse consultant Sarah Coulson, staff at the Holman clinic have been developing plans for what a survivorship care service could deliver for clinic patients. The service would aim to provide specialist clinical advice for patients and their families and other healthcare professionals relating to cancer survivorship. Additionally, the proposed project would look at coordinating and running support groups, in conjunction with NGOs and community partners, and mapping, promoting and linking cancer survivors and their families with existing services, while undertaking quality improvement projects to close gaps in services and resources. There'd also be a strong focus on self-empowerment, while providing education and support to the local community about cancer and living beyond a diagnosis.\n\nThank you to Sarah, Dr Stan Gauden, the director of the Northern Cancer Service, which includes the Holman clinic, and the incredibly professional and dedicated staff at the clinic for the work that you do and for raising the issue of the importance of cancer survivorship with me. I look forward to working further with you and doing what I can to ensure that your survivorship project can get off the ground.\n\nQuestion agreed to.\n\nFederation Chamber adjourned at 12:44","groups":["First Nations","People with chronic health conditions","People in regional or remote areas"],"issues":["Health care\/Health","Negative emotions","Finance","Prejudice and discrimination"],"date":1613606400000,"id":"f83c6905-d87c-4a7c-909e-f99715eaf1a9","year":2021,"month":2}
{"major_topic":"\nBILLS ","minor_topic":"\nAppropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012; Consideration in Detail ","speaker":"Warren Edward Snowdon","content":"It is very important that we acknowledge this 70th anniversary. The importance of the battles of Crete and Greece in our own military history is not well understood, in my view. I certainly did not understand it until I went to Greece and Crete. Having now been there and read the history I understand what events took place and the sacrifices that were made not only by Australian, New Zealand, British and other allied troops but, most importantly, by the Greek nation and by the community in Crete. One of the remarkable aspects of this part of history is that, despite the severity of the treatment by the Germans, support for the Australians and New Zealanders in particular was profound. There is now an ongoing partnership and relationship with Crete\u2014and with Greece more generally but with Crete in this particular case\u2014as a result of those events. I commend the member for Hindmarsh for engaging himself as Chair of the Greek Australian Parliamentary Friendship Group. Very importantly, six veterans attended the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Crete: Daniel Bowden from HMAS \n\nI commend the department, General Mark Kelly, who is now part of our organisation, and those who accompanied the veterans on the support they gave them, but I have to say that the stories we were told were more than payment for doing the work. It was such a pleasure to be with them and learn about them and their stories. We can take great pride in what they did. It was such an incredible privilege to be there and see how they were honoured by the Crete community. The member for Hindmarsh will remember that we called into a small roadside stop to have a toilet break and buy a cup of coffee. We selected some articles, went to pay and the owners refused to take our money\u2014because of the significance and the salience of the presence of those men but particularly the history.\n\nWe went to the Preveli Monastery, which hid hundreds of Australian and New Zealand troops in the hills after the German forces took over and after Australian and New Zealand troops had disembarked on their way back to Egypt. This is important because they survived as a result of the support of not only this monastery but the population, who fed them, clothed them, warmed them, acted as their sentries and worked with them. Some of them worked as guerillas. That was really significant for me.\n\nIt was an enormous privilege to be there and a great honour to be with these men. I know the members for Hindmarsh and Maranoa have both travelled extensively. When you have the privilege of being in these locations, to see the honour with which Australian men who served in these past engagements are held as a result of their integrity and their work is outstanding.\n\nReg Saunders was the first Aboriginal officer and was at Crete at 42nd Street. I just had a chat to his daughter. She sent us a letter and indicated that apparently there is no memorial on 42nd Street to commemorate the involvement of the Anzacs. I want to establish whether that is true and then we might try to do something about it.","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Prejudice and discrimination"],"date":1308009600000,"id":"9c5cc603-c996-4554-a698-3057e3cf3dff","year":2011,"month":6}
{"major_topic":"\nBILLS ","minor_topic":"\nHealth Insurance Amendment (National Rural Health Commissioner) Bill 2017; Second Reading ","speaker":"David Gillespie","content":"I would like to take this opportunity to thank all members on all sides of the chamber for their contributions to this debate on the Health Insurance Amendment (National Rural Health Commissioner) Bill 2017. I thank them for the suggestions they put forward to me directly and during their speeches, which I have endeavoured to incorporate into this legislation. To my Nationals and Liberal colleagues, thank you for your contributions. To the members for Indi, Mayo, Lingiari, Whitlam and many others, as well as my colleague the member for Makin, the shadow minister, opposite: thank you for your contributions.\n\nThere are a few things I would like to summarise and point out again. The legislation and the funding commitment over the forward estimates does allow the coalition government to deliver on an election promise in the lead-up to 2016 made by my colleague Senator Fiona Nash. I anticipate that the role will indeed achieve its broader objectives in helping to deliver all the critical outcomes about which many of us are in furious agreement as to the need for reform and better outcomes. I am hopeful that, in the future, further support can be obtained in both a budgetary and a legislative context.\n\nSeveral people have spoken up about the scope of work the Rural Health Commissioner will be asked to perform, and I would just reinforce, as I mentioned in my second reading speech, that it will be the first and most pressing duty of the Rural Health Commissioner to address the issue of the medical workforce and coordinate with all the various stakeholders, which are numerous, in the development of a rural generalist pathway. The commissioner will provide advice in relation to rural health beyond that. There are very many other matters in which the Rural Health Commissioner will have to be involved, in policy development and championing causes.\n\nI understand the value of multidisciplinary health, and so does just about anyone that works in the health space, particularly in the rural workforce, where there is multidisciplinary care and\u2014whether it is rural or very remote\u2014teamwork is paramount. As I said in my earlier speech\u2014I will quote my own words, just so there is no ambiguity in any way or form about how I think there are more roles for the Rural Health Commissioner than what was alluded to:\n\nWhile the development of the pathways will be the commissioner's first priority, the needs of nursing, dental health, pharmacy, Indigenous health, mental health, midwifery, occupational therapy, physical therapy and other allied health stakeholders will also be considered.\n\nHealth-care planning, programs and service delivery models must be adapted to meet the widely differing health needs of rural communities and overcome the challenges of geographic spread, low population density, limited infrastructure and the significantly higher costs of rural and remote health-care delivery.\n\nIn rural and remote areas, partnerships across health-care sectors and between health-care providers and other sectors will help address the economic and social determinants of health that are essential to meeting the needs of these communities. The commissioner will form and strengthen these relationships, across the professions and for all the communities.\n\nThere were other comments made about an independent or a voluntary advisory group to help the Rural Health Commissioner, and in fact I have brought to the attention of some of the speakers this evening that we do indeed have, and have already set up, a rural stakeholder round table, which last met on 16 November 2016, and the idea that they would work with the Rural Health Commissioner has been established. There were 18 attendees at the last meeting, across all the stakeholder groups in the rural health space. There was the Dental Association, Indigenous health Australia\u2014I could go through a long list, but I just mentioned that there were 18 different stakeholders. It was not an isolated group of people by any means. We had all the voices at the table and the role of the Rural Health Commissioner was spoken about at length, and that person taking advice from that stakeholder meeting and attending it as well was spoken about.\n\nAlso, separate from this legislation, workforce distribution has been raised as a big issue, and within the department I am establishing a distribution working group that will also work with the health commissioner, and there will be representatives from rural health stakeholders as well. The commissioner would be a member of that distribution working group and could use the group to take advice on other of the commissioner's functions.\n\nSo it is always good to flush out good advice and good ideas. I am open to good ideas. But I think there is genuine and universal support for the position. As I mentioned, we have established funding for it up to the defined period, but I am sure it will be a successful role, and I will lend my executive and other support on that basis going forward after that period. I commend the bill to the House.","groups":["First Nations","People with chronic health conditions","People in regional or remote areas"],"issues":["Social connections"],"date":1489968000000,"id":"9312fb65-59e6-4896-b9d6-173082f14510","year":2017,"month":3}

{"major_topic":"\nCOMMITTEES ","minor_topic":"\nStanding Committee on Indigenous Affairs; Report ","speaker":"Ann Sudmalis","content":"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Indigenous Affairs, I present the committee's \n\nReport made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).\n\nby leave\u2014On behalf of the standing committee, I rise today to make a statement with regard to this report. It was presented to the Speaker out of session on 19 December last year.\n\nI acknowledge the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of this nation and the traditional custodians of country throughout Australia. I pay respect to ancestors and elders past, present and future and extend my thanks to all those who took part in the committee's inquiry. In addition, I have come to have a greater respect and understanding of guardianship of culture for our First Nations people. I especially love the work of the dozens of art centre products, some currently on my walls, but the brilliant printing expertise of the women of Nagula Jarndu, a women's art and resource centre, I am wearing today in their honour. You can buy the material and make your own clothing, as I have done.\n\nFirst Nations art and craft is not simply a collection of design elements in some artistic media presentation. Rather, it is integral to their cultural identity, stories and history of the First Nations peoples.\n\nSo it has been alarming to learn that up to 80 per cent of souvenirs sold in Australia, seemingly representing our First Nations cultures, are fake. These imitation products have no connection to First Nations people or their culture and are often cheaply made imports.\n\nAnd although the First Nations fine-art market is not affected by authenticity issues to the same extent, the committee heard some troubling reports of unethical practices in this market as well.\n\nIt is not surprising that First Nations artists and communities feel disrespected and cheated, while for consumers there is no reliable way of knowing if what they are buying is genuine.\n\nThe misrepresentation of First Nations cultures is unacceptable, so the committee makes eight recommendations to significantly reduce the prevalence of imitation products and create opportunities for First Nations artists and their communities. The key recommendations include:\n\nThere are individuals and businesses making outstanding contributions to safeguard Indigenous cultural expression. The committee is keen to support their efforts.\n\nThe Indigenous Art Code does an impressive code of getting businesses to adopt its voluntary code of practice, to behave ethically and responsibly when selling First Nations art and craft, but limited resourcing affects its ability to achieve its full potential.\n\nWe recommend increased resourcing for the Indigenous Art Code with a review after two years to see whether the voluntary code is affected or if a mandatory system should be considered.\n\nAs well, First Nations art centres provide opportunities for artists and communities to foster and preserve their heritage.\n\nUnfortunately, centres struggle to keep qualified staff due to a lack of infrastructure, services and housing. Many would also benefit from greater access to business development expertise. So we recommend more support for capacity building through Indigenous business sector strategy funding. With many centres operating in remote areas, the committee learned about and was inspired by the art centre as businesses and community capacity builders. There are obvious social and economic benefits to growing them as self-supporting businesses.\n\nAdditionally, we believe it is important to better understand the impacts of inauthentic products and, for this reason, recommend that the Productivity Commission conduct a comprehensive analysis of the First Nations art and craft market. This will play a vital role in implementing effective strategies to combat the sale of fake art.\n\nAs to current legislation, consumer law allows the ACCC to take action where there is explicit evidence that consumers have been misled about inauthenticity\u2014for example, by false labelling\u2014but the absence of a consistent and recognisable labelling system for Indigenous art and craft products provides little protection for artists, communities or consumers.\n\nTherefore, we recommend IP Australia, in consultation with stakeholders, develop a certification trademark scheme for First Nations art and craft.\n\nEqually, copyright law is designed to protect an individual's artistic work over several decades, and it does this well, but these protections do not extend to the communal and enduring nature of First Nations traditional knowledge and cultural expression.\n\nFor this reason, we recommend the development of standalone legislation to protect Indigenous cultural and intellectual properties rights. This could be facilitated through the establishment of a national Indigenous art and cultural authority, which is being explored by the Australia Council.\n\nFirst Nations people have been the custodians of their cultures for tens of thousands of years. It is an ethical and moral demand that we assist this guardianship into the future.\n\nIt's my hope that the committee's report and its recommendations will help foster and preserve authentic First Nations cultural expression for the benefit of all Australians.\n\nIn concluding, I'd like to acknowledge that this inquiry would not have been possible without the many contributions from First Nations artists and communities. For this we are extremely grateful. I also acknowledge contributions from industry peak bodies, Indigenous organisations, government agencies, academics and others. I thank the committee's deputy chair, Warren Snowdon, and other committee members for their commitment to this inquiry. I also acknowledge the complete dedication of the secretariat team including Mel Brocklehurst, Kilian Perrem, Louise Milligan, Joel Bateman and Ben Vea Vea and all of the other support staff from broadcasting, Hansard and IT. Without their efforts we would not have been so well able to capture the essence of the guardianship, the love of country and the significance of our Australian First Peoples' songlines. I commend this report to the House.","groups":["First Nations","Older people","People in regional or remote areas"],"issues":["Shelter","Protecting heritage","Government assistance","Human rights"],"date":1549929600000,"id":"7c85d520-ed89-490e-bb2a-2139fa872a06","year":2019,"month":2}
{"major_topic":"\nPRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS ","minor_topic":"\nGreen Army Program ","speaker":"Louise Elizabeth Markus","content":"I rise to speak on the coalition government's Green Army initiative, which continues to deliver very positive outcomes, particularly for our young people and the environment in the electorate of Macquarie and, indeed, across the nation. With projects regularly occurring across the electorate, we are seeing firsthand the benefits of the program on the ground in both the Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains.\n\nWhile supporting local environmental work and heritage conservation projects across Australia, the Green Army initiative is engaging young people aged 17-24 years, and providing them with opportunities to learn new skills to prepare them for a career path they may not have considered before being given this opportunity and gaining this experience. With more than $700 million committed to Green Army projects across Australia over four years, it is making a real difference to environmental assets by restoring and protecting habitats, removing noxious weeds, planting native plants, cleaning up creeks and rivers and restoring cultural heritage places. Recently I had the opportunity to witness firsthand the benefits of the initiative for the youth who have been taking part and who are having a go even if they did not feel particularly interested when they first began.\n\nThere have been many projects in the Hawkesbury and Blue Mountains which have achieved wonderful outcomes for the environment. The Bushells Lagoon project at Wilberforce in the Hawkesbury is one I will mention in particular. The Green Army team that has been working on this project for the last six months recently gave a progress presentation on its challenges, achievements and experiences. The volunteers spoke proudly and confidently about the processes they had been through to re-establish the health of the degraded lagoon and surrounding environment, along with the skills they had learnt and the opportunities that had arisen for future career paths. The Bushells Lagoon project has seen the Green Army team working with the Hawkesbury Environment Network over six months to assess the health and habitat values of the wetland, to provide staged works to remove invasive weeds, to propagate a wide range of suitably local indigenous plant species and to undertake a revegetation program along selected sections of the lagoon's foreshores.\n\nIt was great to seek how much the hard-working participants have gained in experience, knowledge, comradeship and the opportunities it is opening up for them. They are outstanding young people who demonstrated great skill and capacity to apply their learning into transformational outcomes for the environment. Many of those working on the project have also brought a wealth of knowledge on board, through bachelor degrees in natural resource management, water quality, riparian management and animal science which was incredibly valuable. For many, it also sparked the desire for them to continue to work within this field. The volunteers also recognised that the work that had been achieved must be maintained in the future. The project has allowed many to realise they enjoy working with the environment and want to see the hard work that they put in continue to have positive outcomes and continue to be maintained.\n\nThese projects would not be possible without the brilliant work and dedication of the sponsors and team leaders of the Green Army. For the Bushells Lagoon project, it is the Hawkesbury Environment Network and the team supervisor, Andy Araya. These sponsors and team supervisors make the experience educational and fun for volunteers while restoring and protecting our precious environment. I particularly want to thank and congratulate them for their dedication and commitment. The Hawkesbury Environment Network project coordinator, Robin Woods, said she too could see the benefits of the Green Army initiative on both the volunteers and environment. Ms Woods said, 'The team on the Bushells Lagoon project had established over 1,000 plants, undertaken invasive weed control and actively engaged with several landholders to re-establish a healthy natural environment.' Many landholders also spoke of their appreciation to have had assistance in restoring the natural environment on properties. Now is also the time for more young people to get involved in projects, with the next round planned to commence around the electorate of Macquarie\u2014again both in the Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains.\n\nThe Green Army does provide young people across the country with a chance to take part in important environmental and conservation activities while at the same time receive training and skills. Participation is open to a diverse range of young people, including Indigenous Australians, school leavers, gap year students, graduates and job seekers. Participants must be aged between 17 and 24. I encourage the youth of Macquarie to get involved.

{"major_topic":"\nPRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS ","minor_topic":"\nIndigenous Servicemen and Servicewomen ","speaker":"Stephen Jones","content":"It is my great pleasure to speak on this motion, which recognises the service of Indigenous servicemen and women in our military forces in defence of the Australian people. Over 400 Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders served in the First World War, and in excess of 5,000 of them served in the Second World War and have served since then. During my contribution to this debate I will talk about Private Frank Archibald, who was born in Walcha, New South Wales, on 17 February, 1915.\n\nFrank's military service began on 17 May 1940 when, at the age of 25, he enlisted in the AIF along with his younger brother Ron and his uncle Richard Archibald Sr. Frank sailed out of Sydney on 30 August and arrived in Palestine, where he joined his unit, on 30 September. He served in the Battle of Bardia, then in Tobruk, then in Benghazi and then in Crete and Greece. After a short period of leave back in Australia, Frank's unit, 2\/2nd Battalion AIF, left Brisbane on 12 September, 1942. They were bound for Port Moresby and the desperate defence of Australia from the northern onslaught of the imperial Japanese forces. Tragically, on 24 November, Frank was killed in action on the Kokoda Track during the Siege of Buna while trying to save a mate of his. His mate survived; he did not.\n\nSadly, in some ways this is not a remarkable story; many joined our armed forces and served Australia during this time, and too many of them lost their lives in battle as a result. The story is made remarkable by the fact that Frank Archibald was an Indigenous Australian. Hundreds of Indigenous Australians served in the second AIF and the militia under the same conditions as non-Indigenous Australians, in most cases with the promise of full citizenship and rights after the war.\n\nAs a good mate of mine, Freddy Moore, tells me, they could not even get a beer in the front bar of a pub. They had to watch as all their mates who were demobbed at the same time as them walked into the front bar and had a beer, and sometimes if their mates were feeling generous they would pony one out the back door for them. They had to sit under a gum tree out the back\u2014a tragic story, repeated hundreds and hundreds of times around the country. These young boys and men risked their lives\u2014in Frank's case, he gave his life\u2014to serve their country.\n\nSince Frank's death in New Guinea in 1942, the Archibald family has felt great sadness that Private Frank, an Indigenous Australian, has been buried away from his traditional country without the necessary Aboriginal traditional rites having been performed to bring his spirit to rest. I am pleased to advise the House today that on Anzac Day this year 12 members of the Archibald family, including members of his family from my electorate, including his only surviving sibling, Grace Gordon, travelled to Kokoda and performed this ceremony. I was very pleased to be able to assist them. I have to pay tribute to the many corporations and individuals, including Qantas, who funded the trip to ensure that this was a successful ceremony.\n\nThis Saturday the Kokoda Aboriginal Servicemen's Campaign Committee is holding a special event to the celebrate the 70th anniversary of Kokoda Day at the Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway in Concord. This event will highlight the journey to the war cemetery at Bomana on Anzac Day 2012 to visit the graves of six Aboriginal diggers and bring their spirits home to country, and that will be followed by the unveiling of a memorial plaque commemorating Aboriginal servicemen who fought in the Battle of Kokoda. I wish the organisers all the very best for a successful commemoration of a special chapter of Australia's military history and our Indigenous service. In the spirit of reconciliation, I think it is quite proper that we respect their memories; that we do whatever we can to support the families and their ancestors to ensure that they receive the proper rites, as indeed the Archibald family did. I commend the member for Parkes for bringing this matter before the House.\n\nDebate adjourned.","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Protecting heritage","Human rights"],"date":1351468800000,"id":"7dc770cc-6b3e-4f0c-8b13-378424f7dfc3","year":2012,"month":10}
{"major_topic":"\nADJOURNMENT ","minor_topic":"\nParkes Electorate: Bourke Abattoir ","speaker":"Mark Maclean Coulton","content":"I rise tonight to speak and show my strong support for a proposal to build a state-of-the-art small-stock abattoir in the Bourke district in my electorate. This would be of great interest to people in your electorate as well, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott. Bourke has been chosen as the site for the development due to its location as a hub for the goat industry in New South Wales. Bourke Shire Council has been working closely with Capra Developments Pty Ltd for the past few months to assist with facilitating and expediting this project.\n\nCapra Developments has extensive experience in the meat and associated industries and has expressed a very strong desire to have the facility up and running as soon as possible. Capra Developments has indicated that the project investment is approximately $60 million, and it will deliver a best-practice meat processing facility to the Bourke region, focused on marketing goat, sheep and lamb products to a range of well-established export markets and customers. It is anticipated that the abattoir will have a capacity of over 4,000 head of small stock per day, and it is expected to make substantial economic gains for the community and primary producers across the Bourke region. There should be a significant number of employment opportunities\u2014estimated at 200 full-time equivalent positions\u2014as well as a number of other indirect employment opportunities.\n\nThese employment opportunities are greatly needed in the Bourke district. They will assist with overcoming the social disadvantage that has resulted from minimal employment opportunities due to severe drought and population decline. This has adversely impacted on the community over the past few decades, particularly with water reform and the citrus and horticultural industries closing down in Bourke having led to substantial levels of permanent unemployment. The Bourke Aboriginal working party has also expressed major support for the abattoir proposal, as it would not only boost the economy of the region but also provide significant employment opportunities for those within the community who are currently receiving unemployment benefits. Many of these people are, unfortunately, of Aboriginal descent.\n\nCapra Developments Pty Ltd have secured suitable land for the construction of the abattoir about 16 kilometres north of Bourke and are working with Bourke Shire Council in relation to the infrastructure requirements to enable the project to proceed as expeditiously as possible. Bourke Shire Council has submitted an application for funding under round 2 of the National Stronger Regions Fund to assist in the construction of the infrastructure. I strongly support this proposal, and it ties in with a lot of other work that the federal government is doing in that area through Work for the Dole programs and Green Army programs, which I have visited in that area and which are employing young unemployed people in the Bourke and Brewarrina districts.\n\nIt also ties in with the Clontarf Foundation, who are encouraging young Aboriginal boys to stay at school, complete their schooling and gain a level of education that would enable them to undertake meaningful employment. An extra 200 jobs in the Bourke area\u2014permanent, meaningful jobs\u2014would be also very much appreciated.\n\nIt also ties in with the large number of feral goats that are currently in western New South Wales and, indeed, in southern Queensland. This would provide value-adding for this resource which is largely being shipped off to Victoria for processing, and it meets the high demand that we see for goat meat, particularly from markets in the Middle East and growing markets in Australia. This is a very worthwhile project and it has my complete and full support.","groups":["First Nations","Unemployed or precariously employed","General disadvantaged group"],"issues":["Government assistance","General disadvantage"],"date":1448323200000,"id":"fe2cb2de-d8e1-45e0-8617-1abf796bb886","year":2015,"month":11}
{"major_topic":"\nADJOURNMENT ","minor_topic":"\nFocal Extended Inc. ","speaker":"Shayne Kenneth Neumann","content":"Tonight I want to congratulate Focal Extended Inc. on the opening of the Focal Community Centre at 6 Canning Street, North Ipswich. It was my privilege last Saturday to be at the opening of this new facility. The Nunukul Yuggera Aboriginal Dance Group welcomed the dozens of people who were there. Roy Henderson, the president, was the MC. The patron is Sir Llew Edwards, a former member for Ipswich and a former Liberal Party Deputy Premier of Queensland. The executive officer, Tanya Miller, was present; and Rachel Nolan, the member for Ipswich and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Disability Services in Queensland, opened the facility by cutting the ribbon and unveiling the plaque.\n\nFocal Extended Inc. supports individuals who have disabilities and their carers. It is a strange name. It comes out of the Friends of Challinor Aid League, which was formed in February 1974, 34 years ago, in Ipswich. Its vision is to provide support to enable and empower people who have a disability and to help them participate freely in their chosen community\u2014which happens to be my chosen community as well, Ipswich. Focal\u2019s early work involved active lobbying for legislative change regarding the rights of people with disabilities. You could barely be a politician in South-East Queensland in the 1970s and 1980s without receiving some lobbying from Focal. As individuals moved into the community, Focal took a wider support role, and the name was changed to Focal Extended Inc. to reflect that development.\n\nA number of Focal\u2019s members, who are known to me\u2014Lionel Rackley, Peg Tozer, Jim Cummings and Betty McCrindle\u2014had the honour of being awarded the Order of Australia in recognition of their fine community work over the years. Furthermore, Jim Cummings, whom I have known for many years, was awarded the Ipswich Citizen of the Year award in 1995\u2014an honour he certainly deserved.\n\nThe opening of the Focal Community Centre is a new chapter in the life of Focal. The centre provides a home base and it is a place of new opportunities that will be limited only by the imagination of those who attend. There will be tremendous contributions by local residents, and many people have shown tremendous commitment to disability support in Ipswich for a long time.\n\nWhat does Focal do? There are about 16 staff at the centre. There are about 27 support workers and they have five to six who work regularly in vacation care. In the Independent Pathways program they can have up to 15 clients at a time. Independent Pathways is a development program for young people aged 18 to 35. It is designed to assist individuals with a disability to develop skills and independence. There is also an independent living program, which is an accommodation support program for people with a disability. There is a family respite care program, an out of school hours care program\u2014with a senior program and a junior program\u2014and there is a postschool program and adult lifestyle support services, which enhance community access, life skills and vocational training opportunities.\n\nThis is very important for my local area, because the Challinor Centre was a disability centre for people who were institutionalised. In Ipswich there are a lot of people with disabilities who are now in the community leading lives of personal development, social integration, independent living and playing an important role in the life of the community. I congratulate all the people involved in Focal Extended Inc. for their many years of hard work and lobbying, and I look forward to the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children\u2019s Services coming to Ipswich, as he has promised to do. I would be delighted to have him visit the new centre, and the people are looking forward to his visit very much. I hope that will happen later this year or, if not, early in the new year. This is a wonderful community facility and these are wonderful people.","groups":["First Nations","Young people","People with disabilities"],"issues":["Voice","Human rights"],"date":1222128000000,"id":"fc32aacc-4fa4-46fd-9e7d-4e7b2f663c3c","year":2008,"month":9}
{"major_topic":"\nCONDOLENCES ","minor_topic":"\nWalker, Hon. Francis (Frank) John, QC ","speaker":"Andrew Leigh","content":"Frank Walker did more in public life than many of us can ever hope to do. During his time he suffered more than any of us probably ever will. He lost his two sons, Michael and Sean, to suicide. Both died at age 33 and he found both of them. But he contributed an extraordinary amount to our public life. He spent his first years in a Coogee housing commission home. His family moved to New Guinea in 1948 after his father, Jack Walker\u2014a brickworks dragger and a member of the Communist Party of Australia\u2014was black-listed. He was a campaigner for the underdog and perhaps part of that was formed by those early years in Papua New Guinea, sitting alongside indigenous children in coastal villages.\n\nIn 1950s Australia, at the age of 13, he staged his first political act, sitting with segregated Aboriginals at the Sawtell picture theatre. He joined Charlie Perkins on the freedom ride to Moree in 1965. He devoted decades of his life to public life and it was in the latter years that I first came to know him. At university I decided I would write a paper on the New South Wales Left. Frank was generous enough to give me two hours of his time sitting in his electorate office. I look back on my notes today and see that on 22 April 1994 I went to the Robertson electorate office and sat with him, talking through some of the old stories of the faction. Perhaps the one that caught me the most was when Jack Ferguson\u2014member for Werriwa's father\u2014stepped down as Deputy Premier and there was a question as to whether Frank would succeed him. He did not. In somewhat controversial circumstances he was beaten out in that internal ballot.\n\nHe was a full participant in some of those very difficult times for the Left. He voted for Paul Keating in both the leadership ballots and ran for the ministry without the support of the Left. But he took stands on principle. When Prime Minister Bob Hawke spoke on the Iraq war, Frank Walker was one of a handful of members who left the chamber, earning themselves substantial opprobrium in the process.\n\nI remember Frank very much as being generous with his time with me, a young whippersnapper and surely the least important thing on his agenda, but it was a reminder of how those of us in public life should behave when people come to learn from us. I enjoyed very much the story Senator Faulkner told in the other place about when he arrived in his office in Sussex Street to receive a Christmas present from Frank Walker\u2014a New South Wales ALP rule book with every page blank because, as Frank's annotation read, the Sussex Street machine just ignored the party rules anyway. Senator Faulkner has lodged Frank's Christmas present in the National Archives of Australia. My friend Macgregor Duncan, a family friend of Frank's, said the following:\n\n\u2026 I would say that Frank lived his life with great dignity and nobility. As has been well documented, he suffered great sorrow and sadness in his life, enough to make most of us resign in despair and unjustified guilt. But Frank never gave into those emotions. He summoned the will to rise above it all. He was loyal, generous and kind to his friends. And he was an exemplary parliamentarian and minister. For a man who'd had so much taken from him, he gave so much back to his friends, family, community and country. And in a democracy, where we collectively rely on the private exertions of our public leaders, it's important that we celebrate those contributions when so noble and hard-fought.\n\nVale Frank Walker.","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Shelter","Health care\/Health","Freedom","Segregation"],"date":1340064000000,"id":"2939f13f-b29b-46e8-95b1-ce5c41209f71","year":2012,"month":6}
{"major_topic":"\nMATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE ","minor_topic":"\nChild Care ","speaker":"Tim Watts","content":"I welcome the tone that the minister has brought to the debate today. I know that the shadow minister supports this tone of engagement, because the minister is right that Australian families, Australian parents, care about outcomes, not political games here. It is in our overwhelming national interest, however, to encourage as many women as possible to return to the workforce after having children. The evidence on how to make this happen is clear. Unsurprisingly, when making a decision about whether to return to the workforce after having children, Australian families get together and they weigh up the costs and the benefits of that decision. They look at how much they would earn after tax from returning to work, and they weigh that against how much they would have to pay for child care in order to do so. In this respect, the Grattan Institute has noted:\n\n\u2026 there is very good evidence that the major influences on female workforce participation are marginal tax rates and the net costs of childcare.\n\nIt is not rocket science. However\u2014and we should bring this to account in a spirit of engagement\u2014during the last five years the focus of those opposite in this area has been on an expensive and inefficient paid parental leave scheme, against overwhelming evidence that the big game in female workforce participation is child care. Frankly, it shows how out of touch the Prime Minister was with how parents and families make decisions about how to care for their children and how to return to the workforce.\n\nIn 2009 the Productivity Commission noted, in its report \n\nFull replacement wages \u2026 would be very costly and \u2026 would have few incremental labour supply benefits.\n\nSimilarly, the Grattan Institute has made it clear:\n\n\u2026 international experience suggests that government support for childcare has about double the impact of spending on parental leave.\n\nWe hear now, however, that the government wants to start to engage with the main game and is seeking the support of the Labor Party. This is welcome news and we welcome the spirit of engagement. We welcome the government to the real debate that parents and families care about in this space. We want to work with the government to reform this sector so that Australian families will be better off and so that children can get the best start in life.\n\nWe will work constructively on any measure the government comes up with to repair the damage caused by their last budget and we will do it in good faith. We say this because this is a debate that we in the Labor Party have been having since Whitlam. Whitlam was the pioneer of federal involvement in early childhood development. He recognised the importance of supporting community childhood centres and introduced the Child Care Act in 1972. Since then, Labor has introduced fee relief for parents under the Hawke government as well as the childcare rebate and the National Quality Framework, a very important part of this debate in ensuring the quality of care and the developmental effects that our children are getting out of their time in child care.\n\nWe are willing to work with the government but we want to work towards bettering our system, not dismantling it. We will hold the government to account for their cuts to child care in the last budget and we will also resist any attempt by this government to further attack the essential services that Australian families rely on. I know that the Hobsons Bay City Council in my electorate met on Tuesday night of this week to discuss ways to meet the shortfall in government funding for family day care services. The options were not pretty; and, as the largest provider in the area, it spells danger for families in our local community.\n\nWhile we want to work with the government towards a better childcare system, we cannot forget that the government has cut $157 million from family day care services. We cannot forget that the government has cut $450 million to outside school hours care. We cannot forget that the government has cut $105 million to the childcare rebate. We cannot forget that the government has cut subsidies for early childhood education degrees. We cannot forget that the government has cut federal funding for all Indigenous child and family centres. And we will not forget that this government has cut, in total, $1 billion in childcare funding. So we welcome the government to the real debate in this place, and we hope that they enter the debate about funding changes to our system to enable women to return to the workforce so that we can lift our female workforce participation rate up to the higher levels amongst OECD countries instead of the lower levels we have today. And we hope they will support efforts to fund a system that supports quality and investment in our children and investment in our human capital for the next century\u2014investment that will particularly bring disadvantaged families and children along to try to bridge the gap of disadvantage that we currently see in the system.\n\nI say this very genuinely: the minister is right that families do not care about the politics in this place. They care about outcomes for parents, for families and for children. We will engage in this debate in a spirit of good faith and will seek to deliver an outcome, in partnership with the government, that meets these principles.","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Family relations","Voice","Government assistance","General disadvantage"],"date":1424908800000,"id":"baf0ebc5-7eb7-43b4-ab46-e711c73a55ea","year":2015,"month":2}
{"major_topic":"\nMATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE ","minor_topic":"\nEarly Childhood Education: Preschool Funding ","speaker":"Dan Tehan","content":"Can I assure the shadow minister that the government does care and the government does understand how important it is that we invest in our children and that we invest in the education of our children. But where there is a big difference between this side and those opposite is in making sure that you get an educational return on that investment. We don't just throw money at things for money's sake. We want to make sure that when we invest we get the outcomes that we want to see.\n\nIt is absolutely vital, when it comes to investing in early childhood education, that you get those outcomes. That is why in our national partnership agreement which we negotiated with every state and territory for this year, we focused not just on enrolment. We didn't hear any mention of this from the shadow minister. I think, and I hope, that she will listen and learn from this. There was not one mention of it. But it is not just about the investment; it's about making sure you get the educational outcomes on that investment.\n\nLet's have a look at what this government has delivered: in 2015, $405 million; in 2016, $415 million; in 2017, $425 million; in 2018, $428 million; and in 2019, $440 million. But what are we seeing? What we're seeing is that we're getting enrolment figures of around 90 per cent or a little above. But what the most current national data shows is that 30 per cent of children are not attending for the 15 hours on offer. We're saying to the states and territories: we want to work with you to lift this, because it is incredibly important that, if we're investing in early childhood education, we're getting the attendance flowing from that.\n\nWhat happens when we look at vulnerable and disadvantaged children? Attendance declines even further. It's 35 per cent for vulnerable and disadvantaged children, and up to 41 per cent for Indigenous children. And we see a similar figure when it comes to those from rural and remote areas. So when we invest, we've got to make sure that we're investing so that all children right across this nation will see the benefit of this Commonwealth investment in early childhood education. That is what we want to see.\n\nAs I've demonstrated, the money has been there, but what we want to make sure is that not only is the money there but also our children are getting the benefits from it. Otherwise, what you see is that a gap starts to grow between those who are not only able to enrol but also able to attend for the full 600 hours versus those who are enrolling and not attending. When that gap is greatest\u2014when it's dealing with those who are coming from vulnerable and disadvantaged backgrounds, those from Indigenous backgrounds and those from rural and remote backgrounds\u2014we have to make sure that we are fixing it, and that is what the Morrison government is intent on doing. We want to make sure that the benefits from this investment flow right across the nation.\n\nI just want to delve into this\u2014I've got the 2017 ABS figures for preschool attendance for 600 hours in dedicated preschools. This is the proportion of children enrolled in dedicated preschools for 600 hours per year and who attend for the full 600 hours. Let's start with New South Wales: all children, 76 per cent; Indigenous children, 69 per cent; vulnerable and disadvantaged children, 71 per cent. Victoria: all children, 73 per cent; Indigenous children, 63 per cent; vulnerable and disadvantaged children, 67 per cent. Queensland: all children, 75 per cent; Indigenous children, 72 per cent; vulnerable and disadvantaged children, 74 per cent. South Australia: all children, 57 per cent; Indigenous children, 38 per cent; vulnerable and disadvantaged children, 50 per cent. Western Australia: all children, 60 per cent; Indigenous children, 47 per cent; vulnerable and disadvantaged children, 55 per cent. Tasmania: 75 per cent for all children, Indigenous, 69 per cent and vulnerable and disadvantaged children, 71 per cent. Northern Territory: all children 59 per cent, Indigenous, 36 per cent and vulnerable and disadvantaged children is 33 per cent. ACT: 59 per cent, Indigenous 59 per cent and vulnerable and disadvantaged, 68 per cent.\n\nThe truth is that, while we're investing in this very important sector of our education sector, we have to ensure that we are getting the outcomes right across the board. I would ask the shadow minister to think long and hard about this, because it surprises me that in the 10 minutes that she had for this MPI she did not make reference to the need for us to make sure that this investment flows right across our nation.","groups":["First Nations","People in regional or remote areas"],"issues":["Education","Government assistance","Finance","General disadvantage","Vulnerable"],"date":1550534400000,"id":"880a620f-fe28-4715-aed5-53a00fc88eca","year":2019,"month":2}
{"major_topic":"\nAUSTRALIAN NATIONAL PREVENTIVE HEALTH AGENCY BILL 2010 ","minor_topic":"\nSecond Reading ","speaker":"Nicola Louise Roxon","content":"in reply\u2014It gives me great pleasure to briefly sum up on the \n\nThis is vital legislation for anyone who is serious about keeping all Australians healthy and particularly the most vulnerable of our people.\n\nThis is a very important and timely reminder. I think the Minister for Indigenous Health touched on the potential for an agency to drive these sorts of reforms and deliver to the community. I noted the comments from many speakers on this bill and I want to thank the large number of people who spoke on it. It is clearly an issue that many people are passionate about. I know that the shadow minister spoke passionately about the need for more investment in prevention. We do not totally agree on the best ways to do that, but I do not doubt that people are determined to try to make a difference.\n\nUnfortunately, the approach of the opposition to date has meant that an agency that would have been focusing Australia\u2019s attention on prevention from 1 January this year has been delayed. We hope that it will not be delayed again when there are so many opportunities for us to be able to invest in sensible initiatives in the areas of obesity, alcohol and tobacco. Of course, there is the potential for the agency to grow over time and invest in many other preventative health measures. Dr Andrew Pesce from the AMA has said that this would:\n\n\u2026 put momentum back into the prevention focus in Australia.\n\nThese sorts of endorsements are important ones, because the opposition want to paint this as a frolic by the government or as the government being interested just in establishing a new bureaucracy, for the hell of it. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. We believe this is a way of establishing an independent agency, separate from government, with its own budget to be able to drive important public health messages in partnership and collaboration with government, non-government organisations, consumers, industry and public health organisations.\n\nWe would like to thank the many people across the community who have worked with us to try and see this agency become a reality: the Public Health Association in particular, the Cancer Council, the Heart Foundation, VicHealth, Quit Victoria and the AMA\u2014just to name a few who have been very supportive of the establishment of this agency. The non-government sector really have shown leadership in health prevention to governments of all persuasions and I want to pay tribute to their work.\n\nFinally, I thank the many members who have made contributions in this debate. I hope that in this place today we will be able to say that two important pieces of health reform legislation were passed. Of course, this House passed the first piece of health reform legislation earlier today, establishing the Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. We hope the House will see good sense on this and be in that happy place again. In the spirit of working together in this new parliament, I indicate for the benefit of members that we intend to, and are prepared to, accept a number of amendments that have been put forward by the opposition. However we do not intend to accept all of them. I have had those discussions with the shadow minister. He is determined to put each of those amendments, as is his right, and we will speak briefly to those as they are moved. I commend the bill to the House.\n\nQuestion agreed to.\n\nBill read a second time.\n\nMessage from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Government assistance","Vulnerable"],"date":1288137600000,"id":"b050b33d-5075-4037-a1c6-a509bf41ae1d","year":2010,"month":10}
{"major_topic":"\nCONDOLENCES ","minor_topic":"\nCOHEN, The Hon. Barry, AM ","speaker":"Josh Frydenberg","content":"I first associate myself with the outstanding speeches by my parliamentary colleagues. We just heard from the member for Canberra and, before her, the member for Berowra, the member for Dobell, the member for Robertson and the member for Melbourne Ports. In anticipation, we will hear from the member for Fenner.\n\nYesterday's memorial service at Old Parliament House, which I had the privilege to attend, was a celebration of Barry Cohen's big life\u2014his good life. We heard speeches from former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Melbourne Ports, his son Stuart and others. What came through these speeches was a picture of a man, whom I was fortunate to have met, who was first and foremost a proud Australian. He was a proud Jew and he was a proud Labor man. In his many achievements in public life\u201421 years in the parliament\u2014he was responsible for a number of significant achievements which leave a lasting legacy. As the environment minister, I can only look back in awe at what he achieved with regard to Uluru, Kakadu, the Barrier Reef and the Tasmanian wilderness. As the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment, we have heard about his significant contributions. Indeed, our presence in Old Parliament House in some way could be traced to his commitment to restoring that building and ensuring that it stayed for future generations.\n\nAs the member for Robertson, he turned a marginal seat\u2014in fact, a Liberal seat, as we heard yesterday\u2014into a safe Labor seat by door-knocking thousands of homes with his wife, Rae, and a band of loyal supporters and winning respect for his passionate defence of local interests and the local community. He also was the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Bicentennial.\n\nBarry Cohen came to the parliament in a non-traditional way in the sense that he had been a postman and a clerk and had broader business experience. When he came to the parliament, as was said yesterday, he was not a union rep or a party hack. He was somebody who came with a determination to make a difference. In reading his maiden speech to the parliament on 5 March 1970, he talked about how the motivating factor in deciding to become a political activist was: 'I have always been concerned with the question of prejudice, whether that prejudice be based on class, religion or race.' In his maiden speech, he spent the vast majority of the time talking about Aboriginal disadvantage, health, particularly infant mortality, and housing and the need to do better on behalf of our First Australians. We heard yesterday how genuine and long-lasting his commitment was.\n\nMy colleagues the member for Berowra and the member for Melbourne Ports have referred to the fact that he cared deeply about his Jewishness. He was always prepared to wear that on his sleeve and he would speak openly about anti-Semitism where he encountered it as well as issues involving Israel. He was born and raised in Griffith, New South Wales, and he wrote about his local school that, 'There were seven Jewish children in a school of nearly a thousand, and that made us a bit of a curiosity.' He did say that he got his first taste of anti-Semitism when he was at Sydney Grammar School and that 'shocked, hurt and bewildered him'.\n\nIn the parliament, he had a fellow traveller in his support for Israel in Bob Hawke. But it is apt and timely in the presence of our fellow members of the Labor Party to remind them of what he, Barry Cohen, said about the concerns he saw with a lurch to the Left and a growing antagonism towards Israel. He said, 'I'm sick of Labor leaders and foreign affairs spokesmen making all the right noises to Jewish audiences while an increasing number of Labor backbenchers launch diatribes at Israel.' That is a very powerful statement. I only mention it because I know that my fellow Labor members in the chamber care as deeply about Israel and anti-Semitism as I do and as the member for Berowra does. I know, in the Leader of the Opposition, Israel has a staunch and loyal friend. Bob Hawke, who fought for the refuseniks in the Soviet Union, has a very proud record on that. In fact, 'Doc' Evatt, again from the Labor Party, has a very, very proud record on that. We always need to stand firm on these issues. When we stand on the shoulders of giants like Barry Cohen in this place, it pays to listen to a warning such as that. If we, in this place, can take that warning and act upon it, I will feel better for not just the Jewish community of today but the Jewish community of tomorrow.\n\nBarry Cohen was an outstanding individual. He was decent. He was brave. He was humble. He was passionate. His causes stretched from Indigenous affairs to the environment, from the arts and culture to acting on behalf of our senior Australians and his own battle with Alzheimer's.\n\nHe is somebody who shared his views through his columns and his eight books and who has provided wisdom and insight for us here today. To his son Adam, in the chamber; to his mother, Rae; to Stuart; to Martin; to the extended family: you have so much to be proud of in Barry Cohen. I have so much to be proud of as a Jewish member of this parliament. Because we follow in his footsteps, we can learn from his example. And if we do him justice in this place, Australia will be the better for it.","groups":["First Nations","Religious minorities"],"issues":["Shelter","Health care\/Health","Protecting heritage","General disadvantage","Prejudice and discrimination","(In)justice"],"date":1517875200000,"id":"3dd8a8ee-1388-4f8a-a3c3-69cd04e83fb5","year":2018,"month":2}
{"major_topic":"\nQUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE ","minor_topic":"\nIndigenous Health ","speaker":"Nicola Louise Roxon","content":"I thank the member for Dawson for his question. I know he takes a great interest, as most members over this side of the House do, in what we are doing to close the life expectancy gap for Indigenous Australians. The Prime Minister has already taken the House through some of the details of the initiatives that have been announced today, but I think that it is important to go through how these initiatives are meshing with the other initiatives of the Rudd Labor government to make absolutely clear that our vision for Indigenous Australians in a modern Australia is that they have equality of health status, educational status and life expectancy. We are going to do everything we can, whether it is through the health portfolio, the education portfolio, the community services portfolio or elsewhere, to make sure that we turn the ambitious statement of intent that was signed today by the government, by the opposition and by Indigenous leaders into a reality.\n\nWe know that the announcements today are targeting and complementing announcements that we made during the election and have already started rolling out. We of course have a $260 million package on the table for early childhood education and health. We know that this is going to make a huge difference to Indigenous babies who are being born today and that that will have a long-term impact on the life expectancy gap.\n\nBut the announcements made today by the Prime Minister, particularly our investment in cutting smoking rates, are targeted towards adult Indigenous people. We know that we need to cut the smoking rates of everybody who is smoking today. We need to try to bring the smoking rates in Indigenous communities down to those rates that we experience across the rest of the country. We know it is going to need a targeted strategy. The strategies that have been successful but that still need to be repeated in the broader community have largely gone over the heads of the Indigenous community. They have not been targeted in a way that the Indigenous community have been receptive to. This financing will make it possible for us to make sure that the message about smoking and the damage it can do to your long-term health actually is heard by the Indigenous community.\n\nWe really look forward to working with Indigenous health specialists. Those who are involved in social marketing targeted towards particular groups will be able to devise a very sharp message which we hope will make a difference for Indigenous communities. I might also highlight something that our partners in the Indigenous health sector are very supportive of but which does put an obligation on them as well. Part of this initiative is to ensure that health workers in Aboriginal health services are also able to quit smoking and will lead by example. This is a particularly difficult issue for many health workers. As anyone in the House who has been a smoker would know, quitting is difficult for everyone. But we need to be able to turn around and make a big impact in Indigenous communities, and we will need those health workers to lead by example. We are setting aside a specific part of our funding to ensure that we assist them in that process of quitting and setting that example to the community.\n\nI want to also make clear that we are making both short-term and long-term investments. The long-term investment in an Indigenous workforce is going to be a really important part of our solution for the future. If, across all of our electorates, Indigenous health services cannot find Indigenous people to work as nurses and doctors, we know that we will continue to have these complex problems. So, as for investing in the workforce, we know it will take a long time but it must be done if in 10, 20 and 30 years time we are going to meet these targets and actually change the status and life expectancy of Indigenous Australians across the country. Our vision as a government is to close that gap. That is what we want to become a reality, and some of the down payments that have been announced today are very important steps to turning that statement of intent into a reality.","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Health care\/Health","(in)equality"],"date":1205971200000,"id":"cad9eb94-3a0d-48ab-bc92-b443a8707465","year":2008,"month":3}
{"major_topic":"\nMOTIONS ","minor_topic":"\nTuberculosis ","speaker":"Pat Conroy","content":"I rise to support this motion and I acknowledge the member for Leichhardt and the member for Newcastle's longstanding advocacy around tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is an infectious disease spread by airborne dissemination of germs that carry the infection. It most commonly affects a person's lungs but it can also affect other parts of the body, causing serious illness and, in some cases, death. This is a disease which causes enormous suffering around the world. It is estimated that TB affected more than 10 million people and killed 1.6 million people in 2017. Experts have advised that 75 million more people could die by 2050 due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of TB. These are strains where the most commonly used antibiotics are less effective, and more intensive and protracted courses of treatment are required.\n\nIn Australia around a million people are estimated to have a latent or dormant form of TB. It's particularly concerning that, although the incidence of TB in Australia is relatively low, it is some six times higher amongst Indigenous Australians than amongst non-Indigenous Australians. Yet, because it's a disease which is not as prevalent in our country today as it was in earlier generations, there is a risk that Australians become less aware of the impact of this disease. If we need reminding of those risks, we only need to look at our nearest neighbour, Papua New Guinea.\n\nA tuberculosis epidemic is raging in PNG. The country has the highest incidence of TB in the western Pacific region. It is currently experiencing over 30,000 new cases a year. Multidrug-resistant TB rates are particularly high in recognised hotspot areas such as Western Province, the National Capital District and Gulf Province. Port Moresby General Hospital now has a dedicated ward for TB sufferers. Many of the TB patients in the Port Moresby hospital are young children, with reports that paediatric TB cases make up more than a quarter of all cases in PNG. That is a tragic state of affairs.\n\nIn my role as shadow minister for international development and the Pacific, I have met many dedicated Australian aid workers and non-government organisations who work on development challenges around our region\u2014challenges of poverty and economic development; challenges of health care, education and social development; and challenges of protecting vulnerable people in developing countries: women, children, people with disabilities, the elderly and those suffering from illness and disease. Earlier this year I met with a delegation from the advocacy group RESULTS Australia, a group of dedicated people from different walks of life, committed to fighting poverty around the world. One of their key issues is tuberculosis. They noted the particularly high burden of TB in Papua New Guinea and made the point that people suffering from TB in PNG are often also infected by HIV-AIDS. As the RESULTS delegation told me, these diseases are preventable, but what is needed to prevent them is funding.\n\nAustralia is providing significant funding for the fight against TB. We are working with the World Bank to support testing, diagnosis and treatment in PNG. We have also provided $75 million over five years for Product Development Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific Health Security Initiative, which is tackling TB and malaria. In the context of funding, I would point to the importance of the forthcoming replenishment of the Global Fund. The Global Fund is an international partnership to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. It mobilises more than $4 billion a year from governments and the private sector to support programs run by local experts in more than 100 countries. The fund's sixth replenishment conference is being held in France in October. Australia has been a longstanding supporter of the Global Fund, contributing more than $700 million to date. I urge the government to renew this commitment for the period from 2020 to 2022 at this year's conference.\n\nThe UN Sustainable Development Goals include the target of ending the epidemic of TB by 2030, along with the epidemics of malaria, AIDS and neglected tropical diseases.

{"major_topic":"\nMATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE ","minor_topic":"\nRural and Regional Health Services ","speaker":"Justine Elliot","content":"I am very pleased to be speaking on this MPI on the government's broken promises and failures in rural and regional health, because there are so many broken promises. It has been interesting listening to the contributions from the other side. I do not recall any of them talking about the GP tax. All of those speakers from the Minister for Health to all the backbenches. I particularly note the member for Lyne not once in his contribution mentioned the $7 doctor tax. I wonder what the good people of Lyne\u2014the people who are severely impacted by his support for such an unfair, cruel and unjust tax\u2014think of that. It is fascinating. None of them were prepared to defend any of their harsh and cruel actions. We will certainly outline some of them. You have heard some of the harsh actions outlined today by the speakers on our side.\n\nThe fact is this government has a trail of broken promises across a huge range of areas, and for regional areas those cuts to health are some of the very cruellest. The fact is that the Liberal-National Party is continuing to punish people in regional and rural Australia. In fact, it is the Nationals who are responsible for these cruel cuts to health. Indeed, the cruellest cut is probably the $7 doctor tax, which makes it so much harder for people in country areas to actually access health services. It is one of their many, many broken promises.\n\nThe fact is that in rural and regional Australia out-of-pocket health costs are higher, and they will only increase with this government's unfair policies. Indeed, another broken promise was about Medicare locals. We have spoken about that today as well. This will have a huge impact on regional areas because Medicare locals have been very effective particularly at coordinating a lot of different services in rural areas that did not have that before. They have been able to provide great services where there were gaps before. Of course it is another broken promise. I refer to this wonderful book about the Abbott government's broken election promises\u2014there are so many. This book refers specifically to health, but there are many listed. We return to 28 August 2013, when the Prime Minister\u2014the then Leader of the Opposition\u2014said, 'We're not shutting any Medicare locals.' What happened? They broke that promise. All 61 Medicare locals will be axed. This is devastating for regional areas. Not many from the city electorates over there would understand, and we know the regional ones do not care. Medicare locals actually do an incredibly important job in our rural areas, so we certainly need to have them in place.\n\nAs we have heard other speakers say today, people living in rural and regional areas have some of the very poorest health outcomes. Incomes are low, and we know that chronic disease rates are much higher. There is also a higher proportion of Indigenous population with poorer health conditions. Access to health is more expensive, and there are also far greater distances in regional areas. That is why other broken promises like the petrol tax are devastating; people have to travel further in regional areas. So that is another broken promise that impacts people.\n\nAs I have said, people in regional areas have poorer health outcomes. Despite all of this, the Abbott government's first budget really declared war on Medicare. It really was horrendous. Introducing the doctor tax for all patients will cost over $1.4 billion to communities living outside metropolitan centres, and those rural and regional patients will be charged over and over again when they see the doctor, when they fill their prescriptions and when they get scans, X-rays and blood tests as well. That, on top of the increases to PBS medicines, will just mean that people from these regional areas will not access healthcare services. That is what your government has done. People from these areas just will not do it. That is what they are telling us. They simply cannot afford it.\n\nBut let's compare all of that\u2014all that devastation, all of that harm, all of those hurtful policies\u2014to what Labor did when we were in government and the great changes we made.\n\nWe have a very proud record when it comes to health reform. Firstly, we are the party that introduced Medicare 30 years go\u2014and we are very proud to be defending it today. We also made great advances, when we were in government, getting GPs to rural and regional areas, and increasing bulk-billing rates to the highest level in history. That is a great achievement. Labor lifted the bulk-billing rates to over 82 per cent, on average.\n\nWhen the now Prime Minister was health minister they were as low as 67 per cent. That is pretty low. We also heard some great achievements\u2014like the GP superclinic in my electorate, which is fantastic. It was funded, built and delivered by Labor, and it provides a great variety of allied health services. So we will always fight to ensure that there are great health services in our regional areas. But the biggest attack on future health and hospital services in rural and regional areas comes from the National Party. It comes from the National Party because they are out there with cruel policies like the doctor tax. They are pursuing the funding cuts in hospitals and they are devastating regional areas.

{"major_topic":"\nCOMMITTEES ","minor_topic":"\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Committee; Report ","speaker":"Warren Edward Snowdon","content":"I acknowledge the contribution from the chairman of the committee and the work of the committee and all its members. It is with regret, though, that I have to say that I am here to present, on behalf of the members for Fremantle, Canberra and Kingsford Smith, and for my own part, a dissenting report. In what may be a precedent in committee reporting, the Labor members of the ATSIA committee were not prepared to endorse the majority report of this inquiry into Indigenous employment. This was not because of any fundamental disagreement with the few recommendations it proposed\u2014although we do not agree with all of them\u2014but because of the report\u2019s failure to come to grips with the gravity of the problem or to suggest policy settings and programs which have any real prospect of increasing employment.\n\nWe argued that the chairman\u2019s draft report, as initially presented to us and still largely unmodified in the final draft, needed a major revision. In fact, much of the report is little more than a catalogue of case studies. Those could have formed the starting point for sound deductions about future directions for effective policy development. Instead, they are simply presented without coherent analysis.\n\nThe majority report appears to accept untested assertions about various programs and public relations assertions from the private sector as if they are as persuasive as carefully constructed evaluations. Government department and agency claims about the effectiveness of various policy settings are often accepted without question, rather than being subjected to reasonable critical scrutiny and analysis. The purpose of the report, after all, was to try and find out what really worked. Our constructive suggestions along these lines and our request for a major revision of the report so that we could achieve unanimity were initially accepted but later refused, on what we believed to be rather spurious grounds\u2014in other words, in this case, spuriously imposed deadlines that prevented such revision.\n\nAfter almost three years of hearings, including the evidence of many witnesses, 137 submissions, and travel to every corner of the continent, the conclusions are disappointingly shallow. We argue that the findings and recommendations presented to us in the draft report, and accepted by government members, fall so far short of what is needed as to constitute an insult to the many people who spoke to us.\n\nSadly, given the resources at our disposal and our truncated reporting time line, the Labor members are not in a position to write a comprehensive report which would fully address these problems. But we can point to areas where a future government should act. We touched on those areas. We talked about evaluation. We asked: what has been successful in generating new opportunities for Indigenous people? What maintains employment for those already in the workforce? What improves labour market readiness? And what helps people over the obvious obstacles that Indigenous people face?\n\nWe talked about the Indigenous employment strategy. We asked whether it really has delivered measurable benefits and outcomes to Indigenous people. We focused on the CDEP, and I would say that this report needs to be read against the backdrop of the federal government\u2019s intervention in the Northern Territory and, indeed, its proposal\u2014now writ into policy\u2014to stop CDEP operating altogether in communities in the Northern Territory, despite the ample evidence that this committee received about its success as an employment vehicle for Aboriginal people. This has not been taken into account by the government and has not been reflected properly in the report. But we saw, time after time, the opportunities created by CDEP, where people were in meaningful employment. They were participating in commerce, in shops; they were working in schools and in brick factories; they were working in a range of programs, doing the whole gamut of community activities\u2014you name it, they were involved in it. Yet, now, 8,000 such individuals in the Northern Territory have been sacked summarily by this government and have been moved onto Work for the Dole programs or training programs. They will not have meaningful employment. That, of course, is a shame.","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Government assistance"],"date":1186963200000,"id":"7dcb0905-e27a-43d1-8ffb-a676730bd512","year":2007,"month":8}
{"major_topic":"\nBILLS ","minor_topic":"\nEnhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2018; Second Reading ","speaker":"Rebekha Sharkie","content":"I rise to support the Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2018. This bill criminalises the non-consensual sharing of intimate images and complements the earlier legislation passed by this House and by the parliament, the Enhancing Online Safety for Children Amendment Act 2017. I wish to use this opportunity to express my deep thanks and gratitude to my colleague, former Senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore, whose contributions to the development of both bills were meaningful, heartfelt and significant. This was certainly an issue very close to the senator's heart.\n\nIn relation to the previous bill, I spoke about the frequency of image based abuse in our society and the severity of its impact, and I'll briefly revisit and summarise those remarks. I noted that, sadly, the frequency of non-consensual sharing of intimate images, more controversially known as revenge porn, is increasing in Australia. I referred to an RMIT study that found that an astonishing one in five Australians have experienced image based abuse. The study found that people who were disabled, Indigenous Australians and younger Australians were more likely to be victims, although the issue does affect many Australians from all corners of our society. Women and men are equally likely to report being a victim, but women are more likely than men to fear for their safety due to image based abuse.\n\nThe non-consensual sharing of intimate images causes real harm, not only to women but predominantly to women. It stigmatises victims, destroys social relationships, causes great anxiety and distress and leads to serious mental health issues. Despairingly, in some cases, these acts have led to self-harm and to people taking their own lives. Although revenge pornography has been the focus of most of the attention, the non-consensual sharing of images, as some fellow honourable members have mentioned today, is often used by perpetrators as a means of blackmail and control, to extract money, disrupt relationships and compel unwanted sexual acts. The same RMIT study found that four in five Australians agree it should be a crime to share sexual or nude images without permission. It is no surprise that the level of support for criminalisation is so high.\n\nI commend the parliament for working together to ensure that these atrocious acts become criminal offences. The government's amendments to this bill are a compromise. While the amendments do not introduce the additional offences proposed by Centre Alliance to specifically target image based abuse, they do build on and strengthen existing offences to punish those who use technology to share private sexual material. I strongly urge the parliament to support this bill.","groups":["First Nations","People with disabilities","People with chronic health conditions"],"issues":["Health care\/Health","Violence","Crime\/criminal justice","Negative emotions"],"date":1534377600000,"id":"1e8fd463-9b8e-4a78-979a-eafd8612d13f","year":2018,"month":8}
{"major_topic":"\nADJOURNMENT ","minor_topic":"\nBanks Electorate: Salvation Army ","speaker":"Daryl Melham","content":"Last Thursday, 19 May 2011, I hosted the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon. Jenny Macklin MP, during her visit to my seat of Banks. The purpose of the visit was to show the minister the work done by the Salvation Army St George Community Welfare Centre in Hurstville, particularly in the area of providing emergency assistance to those in desperate need. The Salvation Army has a 130-year history of helping the poor and the disadvantaged.\n\nThe minister met case managers, both full time and volunteer, together with senior Salvation Army representatives. What really struck both of us was the room at the back of the offices where food and other basic commodities are kept to provide immediate assistance to people coming in off the street.\n\nThe minister outlined the government's plan, announced in the recent budget, to continue to provide funding for emergency relief and financial counselling through agencies such as the Salvos. The government will be providing an extra $83.3 million to vulnerable Australians over the next four years. This represents a 60 per cent increase on base funding for emergency relief providers across Australia.\n\nIn my seat $151, 693 will be provided to the Salvation Army, $175,366 to St Vincent de Paul in Hurstville and $176,434 to Padstow Community Centre\u2014a total of over $500,000 for the electorate of Banks alone in 2011-12. This funding will ensure that local people will have access to emergency assistance, including food, clothing and pharmacy and transport vouchers, when they need it most. With our patchwork economy, it is vital that we do not forget those in need. In addition the Australian government will continue to support the No-Interest Loans Scheme, which the Salvation Army's St George community welfare centre currently provides in Hurstville. No-interest loans help people on low incomes make household purchases to meet unexpected costs such as buying a new washing machine. The popular program is delivered nationally by local community organisations in partnership with Good Shepherd Youth and Family Services and NAB. The Australian government is providing $60.6 million over the next four years to support innovative projects such as no- and low-interest loan schemes, matched savings schemes and financial literacy projects.\n\nIn my years practising as a legal aid solicitor and barrister, there were occasions when my clients were desperately in need of life essentials and counselling. The Salvos never let me down. This year the Salvation Army's Red Shield Appeal will be held on May 28-29 and I will again be involved in assisting the many volunteers as they knock on doors. In my experience, very few people say no to the Salvos and, in fact, are usually very generous. One of the Salvation Army majors I met last week was just on his way back from speaking at local schools to encourage students to act as door-knocking volunteers. I encourage people to either volunteer to assist in collecting for the Red Shield Appeal or, if collectors arrive on your doorstep on 28 or 29 May, to give as generously as you can. I was very pleased to meet with my local Salvos and to introduce the minister to the hard-working team at Hurstville. Again, I encourage everyone to become involved in assisting the Salvos in their vital work.\n\nThis is the sort of assistance that should be given by government. There is a partnership here and the money that we give is miniscule compared to the effort that is given by the volunteers of all those organisations in assisting the dispossessed and the needy in our community. It is a Good Samaritan approach. If we were to actually pay these organisations what they were worth, our budget would be continually in the red on that alone. Volunteerism is something that Australians are well known for, and that was shown in the Sydney 2000 Olympics. This is another area of volunteerism where these volunteers will use the money from the government to help those most in need in our community. They are not the loudest. They are the most vulnerable. They are not greedy. They are in need. You judge a civilised society on the way it helps those in need. We do not put the boot into them. We help them. We give them a hand up. That is why I think the government's increase in funding is something to be commended and lauded.","groups":["First Nations","Young people","People living in poverty","People on welfare"],"issues":["Shelter","Education","Voice","Government assistance","Finance","General disadvantage","Vulnerable"],"date":1306281600000,"id":"190b4991-2295-4355-84e2-bccbf98cc84c","year":2011,"month":5}

{"major_topic":"\nBILLS ","minor_topic":"\nVeterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Participants in British Nuclear Tests) Bill 2011; Second Reading ","speaker":"Jill Griffiths Hall","content":"I always enjoy following an opposition speaker when they support legislation the government is putting before the parliament. It is a rare and refreshing turn of events. I thank the shadow minister for his support and at the same time I would like to commend the Veterans\u2019 Affairs Legislation Amendment (Participants in British Nuclear Tests) Bill 2011 to the House.\n\nI have a long corporate memory when it comes to nuclear and atomic veterans. When I first came to this parliament it was very difficult for any nuclear or atomic veteran to receive any recognition or any compensation for illnesses that they received as a result of the time they were in areas where they were exposed to atomic waste. I had one constituent in particular who was in the RAAF and was at Maralinga. At the time he was there he worked in trucks. When the atomic testing was on he would go out and then come back covered in dust. He would just walk in and throw his clothes in the washing machine. There was no testing or monitoring to see whether or not he suffered any illnesses or side-effects from his exposure. He actually developed acute myeloid leukaemia. An interesting aside to this is that his wife has developed breast cancer and their first child was still-born. I find it very difficult not to join the dots there and in some way attribute it to the time that he spent at Maralinga.\n\nHe has had a long battle over the time to get recognition. When I first met him he received no recognition at all. I pay tribute to the fact that, in 2006, legislation was passed through the parliament that changed the situation slightly. But still he has many battles to face in relation to acceptance of his illness and for the fact that although he may be in remission at the moment there is the psychological impact of his illness and the impact it has on his life, and the fact that his wife is very sick. I do not think it is treated in the same way as other conditions. The bar is just that little bit higher, and I think that is inappropriate.\n\nThe legislation before us today amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Testing (Treatment) Act 2006 to enable the Repatriation Commission to determine by legislative instrument additional eligibility criteria for British nuclear defence service under the VEA and nuclear test participation under the APBNT(T)A. This will ensure that there is equitable access to benefits for Australian participants, be they service personnel or not, in the British nuclear tests that took place. It will involve maintenance and decontamination or transport of aircraft which were contaminated as a result of the British nuclear tests.\n\nThe constituent I spoke about was actually lucky, if you can say that anyone who was involved in that situation was lucky, in that he was a member of the RAAF. He has been able to get assistance earlier than he otherwise would have. But many people worked out there in different capacities and were not part of the services. The legislation before us will give some equity to those people who were doing their work and suffered as a result of the British nuclear tests.\n\nThe APBNT(T)A provides government funded, non-liability healthcare treatment for cancer in the form of a white card for those people who were involved in the British nuclear test program in Australia. Also, disability pensions, healthcare treatment and a range of other benefits are provided for former Defence Force personnel. I reiterate that that was not the case for a very long period of time. It is the case now and I think it is really important for that assistance to be extended, and this legislation does that. I do not see how any member of this parliament could object to the legislation. The amendment to the VEA allows newly-found eligible assistance participants to have their claim treated in the same way as they would have had they been eligible in the first instance. Once again, that is the correct way to handle it, and it shows a little compassion for those people who have suffered for such a very long time. As I previously mentioned, they have suffered not only physically but psychologically. People do not know when they may exhibit side-effects from their exposure to the British nuclear test program. Governments should be very mindful of the fact that many people suffer as a consequence of decisions made in the past, and this bill recognises this.\n\nTo run through a few facts and figures, 3,235 Navy personnel, 1,658 Army personnel, 3,223 RAAF personnel and 8,907 civilians, including 10 Indigenous people, were involved in the British nuclear test program. Many of those 8,907 civilians are still surviving, and the bill will give them access to similar treatment and benefits as those personnel in the defence forces. I commend the legislation to the House and congratulate the minister on having the foresight to extend the eligibility to this program in the way that he has.","groups":["First Nations","Older people","People with disabilities"],"issues":["Health care\/Health","Voice","Government assistance","(in)equality","Prejudice and discrimination"],"date":1318377600000,"id":"81ca45d7-b60e-442c-b786-8bd4fcd76106","year":2011,"month":10}

This is a summit that I run each year and which brings together students, principals and teachers from schools across the electorate of Petrie. The Schools Summit is a full-day workshop on eight important topics that the schools have contributed to. We work through the topics and at the end of the day the ideas are put together in a submission that will be presented to the Prime Minister, the federal Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, the state Premier and our local mayor so that all three levels of government are aware that our local young people and educators have a voice. This year's topics were: bullying, the proposed year 7 transition to high school, the value of arts and education, community spaces for young people, healthy Australia in the future, media and social wellbeing, role models and iPads in schools.\n\nI would like to thank Deception Bay State High School for hosting the summit this year. Every year a different school in the electorate hosts the summit. Not only did Deception Bay State High School host the event this year; its hospitality students catered the event and were assessed on their preparation and service of the food, which was absolutely exquisite. They did an amazing job.\n\nWe had 114 participants this year: 36 primary school students, 11 middle school students, 22 secondary school students, 27 educators and 18 chairpersons overseeing the 13 working groups. Twenty-four schools participated in the event: Aspley East State School, Aspley State High School, Bounty Boulevard State School, Bracken Ridge State High School, Bracken Ridge State School, Clontarf Beach State High School, Clontarf Beach State School, Dakabin State High School, Deception Bay Flexible Learning Centre, Deception Bay North State School, Deception Bay State High School, Deception Bay Community Youth Programs, Deception Bay State School, Grace Lutheran College, Grace Lutheran Primary School, Hercules Road State School, Moreton Downs State School, Mueller College, North Lake State College, Scarborough State School, Southern Cross Catholic College, St John Fisher College, St Joseph's Catholic Primary School and St Paul's School.\n\nWe had convenors from across the electorate including representatives from local Indigenous groups, businesses, our Police Citizens Youth Club, the Queensland Police Service Child Protection and Investigation Unit, Regional Development Australia Moreton Bay, Brisbane Airport Corporation, School Community Relations, Redcliffe Environmental Forum and the owner of McDonald's Bracken Ridge, as well as a youth worker from Deception Bay Community Youth Programs.

{"major_topic":"\nADJOURNMENT ","minor_topic":"\nRotary International ","speaker":"Josh Frydenberg","content":"I rise to pay tribute to the wonderful work undertaken by Rotarians throughout the world, particularly the 10 local Rotary organisations that play an active role in the electorate of Kooyong. Founded in 1905 by Chicago lawyer Paul Harris, Rotary's mission is, in its own words, to provide service to others, encourage high ethical standards in all vocations and help build goodwill and peace in the world. From a seed of an idea first countenanced over lunch between Harris and three business friends, the organisation derived its name as early meetings were rotated between the offices of the members. The exponential growth in its membership over the last hundred-plus years now sees the organisation comprising 1.2 million Rotarians, belonging to over 32,000 clubs in more than 200 countries. Its values are universal and transcend any form of national boundaries or explicit race, religious or linguistic ties.\n\nRotarians are exemplified as individuals who do not seek fame or fortune but are motivated by an active intent to contribute to their local communities. Rotarians in return enjoy some immense satisfaction from their contribution to humanity and the fellowship they share with their fellow members. In Kooyong, I have been fortunate to have met many fine Rotarians and indeed I am an honorary member of the Rotary Club of Canterbury. I have seen firsthand the fantastic work each club does in our community. I would like to pay tribute to each club individually.\n\nThe Rotary Club of Balwyn is extremely active and well known. It has raised a significant sum of money over the years and distributed to it many deserving causes, including scholarships for Indigenous youth, medical research, disaster and drought relief and, importantly, youth leadership programs. I pay tribute to outgoing president, Ken McQualter, and incoming president, Peter Freuh.\n\nThe Rotary Club of Canterbury has also had an extremely busy year under the presidency of Kyle Wightman. Its work supporting children with disabilities at Bel\u00admore School, the Boroondara Cares program for communities suffering the impacts of drought and in the Philippines, including an eye screening project, is to be commended. Best of luck to incoming president, David Chudasko.\n\nThe Rotary Club of Boroondara has supported Camcare, Cancer Council, youth leadership awards and international projects in the Philippines and Tibet. Best of luck to incoming president, Rosemary Waghorne, and thank you to outgoing president, Greg Vero.\n\nThe Rotary Club of North Balwyn has done terrific work for the community of Tulagi in the Solomon Islands, including the refurbishment and provision of equipment for the community school and the medical centre. It has helped the Eva Tilley Home locally and been responsible for the establishment of Jack Nankervis House, which I have visited which provides a home for young people in need. Well done to outgoing president, Findley Cornell, and welcome to incoming president, Matthew Pauli.\n\nThe Rotary Club of Mont Albert and Surrey Hills has focused on leadership and education programs, including the dictionary project, the youth science forum and primary and secondary schools speech competitions. It has also done important regional work. Congratulations to outgoing president, Joe Somers, and welcome to incoming president, Tony Kuc.\n\nThe Rotary Club of Glenferrie under Ian Salek has been renowned for its work at the Boroondara farmers market and contributed much locally and internationally, particularly through its eye-care projects in West Sumba, Indonesia. Best of luck to incoming president, Don Heath.\n\nThe Rotary Club of Hawthorn, where I recently enjoyed their changeover dinner, has done much under the presidency of Meredith Hayes and we look forward to the presidential term of Geoff Dumayne. The club's work in establishing the Hawthorn Community Chest decades ago is still running today and their work providing toolboxes to the people of East Timor and immunisation services in Mumbai has made a real difference.\n\nThe Rotary Club of Kew, under outgoing president, Jonathan Shepherd, and now with new president, Michael Stillwell, has done much through its local design projects, inclu\u00adding the Kew Rotary Garden DesignFest and internationally in East Timor with its village women and children project, training people to work in soap-making cooperatives.\n\nThe Rotary Club of Camberwell under the outgoing chair, Robert Davies, and incoming president, David Baker, is in its 44th year of the Camberwell Rotary Art Show. It supports Boroondara Cares, including its drought relief program in the Moira Shire on the Murray River.\n\nThe Rotary Club of Kew on Yarra, under David Shave and new president, Ed Brown, supports a number of not-for-profit charit\u00adable organisations, including Guide Dogs Australia, Camp Getaway for young disadva\u00adntaged people and is also doing important work with drought relief in towns of Cobram and Yarrawonga.\n\nAll these groups deserve to be congratulated for their efforts at being fine Rotarians and significantly contributing to the community of Kooyong. Thank you from a grateful local community.","groups":["First Nations","Young people"],"issues":["Negative emotions"],"date":1309996800000,"id":"8f5630d9-1e13-4402-a522-9b0d10bba7eb","year":2011,"month":7}

One of the first people to see me when I was elected was Kevin Hamilton, who came to lobby me on this issue. I am very pleased that the Rudd Labor government has delivered, after many years of many governments discussing this issue. We have committed $50 million to introduce the national seniors transport concession scheme for seniors card holders by 1 January 2009. It is very important for seniors who are travelling interstate to visit families, friends or grandchildren. Previously, their discounts were not acknowledged, and sometimes you would think we needed a visa to cross a border in this country. It is about time we conform things across all states. I am a very big believer of that.\n\nWe are also committed to reintroducing the Commonwealth dental scheme to aid those who are young\u2014teenagers\u2014and those who are older to access affordable dental care. There are hundreds of elderly residents within my electorate who are currently languishing on dental waiting lists, and have been for many years, who are in need of care. I have supported and will continue to adamantly support the reintroduction of this scheme. We are going to end the blame game. The government has also reached an agreement with the states to provide $150 million to help 25,000 patients get the elective surgery they need. Too many people are currently waiting too long to get that surgery. This $150 million commitment will help slash the number of people waiting longer than clinically recommended for elective surgery, and $13.6 million of that will go to South Australia to deliver an additional 2,262 procedures.\n\nI was also pleased to see in the budget announcement that the Glenelg Wastewater Treatment Plant, which is in my electorate, has had $31 million committed to it. This will ensure that there is a pipeline that takes water treated at the wastewater treatment plant at Glenelg to pump it through the electorate of Hindmarsh into the CBD, ensuring that along the way industry, schools, governments and local councils use the water that would normally be pumped out into the sea into the Gulf of St Vincent.\n\nThis government is aware that we need to address the needs of everyone\u2014including the aged and those on fixed incomes, such as the disability support pensioners and carers\u2014within our society. We have a commitment to assist those in need to help them make ends meet. I have listened to and will continue to listen to the concerns and questions of all residents of Hindmarsh and I commend the appropriation bills to this House.","groups":["First Nations","Older people","People with disabilities"],"issues":["Government assistance","Finance","Prejudice and discrimination"],"date":1212364800000,"id":"62618765-ce58-4d1d-bbaa-323ec2110cd6","year":2008,"month":6}

I acknowledge the very important work he's doing in that regard.\n\nIn the Social Services portfolio, the 2018-19 budget continues the government's commitment to providing a genuine safety net for those most in need while making it more sustainable by strengthening the integrity of the welfare system. As the Treasurer said in his budget speech, it is part of the government's guarantee to provide the essential services that Australians rely on like Medicare, hospitals, schools and caring for older Australians.\n\nIn this financial year, the Social Services portfolio is seeking $10 billion in funding to deliver on the government's policy priorities, programs and services that improve the lifetime and wellbeing of people and families in Australia. The Department of Social Services will also administer $115.3 billion\u2014around one quarter of the total Australian government budget. The budget introduces a range of measures to support people with disability and vulnerable families, and to assist Indigenous and regional students to complete their education.\n\nThe government is providing a range of innovative measures to assist older Australians with more choice in retirement. The budget includes $258.6 million to support people of age pension age to achieve a better standard of living during their retirement. From 1 July 2019, there will be changes to the pension work bonus, the pension loan scheme and the means-test rules for pooled lifetime retirement income streams.\n\nFrom 1 July 2019, the amount that social security pensioners can earn through work before it is assessed under the pension income test will increase by $50 a fortnight to $300 a fortnight. The maximum work bonus accrual amount will increase from $6,500 to $7,800. Additionally, for the first time, self-employed recipients will be able to access the work bonus. This increase will benefit about 81,500 social security pensioners and 850 allowance recipients each fortnight and will importantly improve our economy.\n\nAs the Council on the Ageing noted, the measure is important to fight ageism in the workforce, tap into the experience of older Australians and provide flexibility in retirement. In addition to this, from 1 July 2019 the pension loan scheme will be expanded with the available fortnightly loan plus pension amount increasing from 100 to 150 per cent of the maximum rate of the fortnightly age pension. This will provide an option for people of age-pension age with property to enjoy a higher standard of living. This change will benefit, for the first time, pensioners of age-pension age with property who currently receive the maximum rate and previously could not access the Pensions Loan Scheme. Self-funded retirees with property who currently cannot access the scheme will also benefit from this change and be able to apply for a loan.\n\nThe 2018-19 budget reaffirms the government's focus on the safety and wellbeing of communities, families, women and children in Australia, and people with disability. The government has committed an additional $11.5 million over 18 months to enhance the capacity of 1800RESPECT, the national domestic and family violence and sexual assault counselling information and support service. An addition $6.7 million will be provided for domestic violence response training to train around 7,400 front-line workers such as nurses, counsellors and disability and settlement service workers.\n\nThe budget also continues the government's commitment to the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and I welcome the presence of the assistant minister here today and commend her on the outstanding job she's doing. In the coming year, we will have an additional 750 staff added to the NDIS and full rollouts in New South Wales and South Australia.

This budget invests in essential services on a variety of fronts within the health space. We see a $6 billion investment in Medicare over and above that which was there\u2014an increase. We go from $30 billion to $31 billion to $32 billion to $33 billion per annum over the course of the budget. In aged care a $17.7 billion increase will take aged care from $26 billion to $29 billion to $31 billion to $33 billion, almost as much as Medicare, over the course of the final year of the forward estimates.\n\nBut one of the most important investments is in mental health. Every single person in this chamber is interested in mental health, as a member for parliament but also as a mother or a father, as a son or a daughter, as a friend or as somebody within their community. We all know the challenges and the ravages of mental health. We saw predictions of catastrophic outcomes in terms of suicide last year. From the latest advice I have, thankfully we have been spared that.\n\nBut there's still so much more to do on suicide prevention. In mental health, we're investing $2.3 billion. To sit around the budget cabinet table with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, for whom this was an equal passion, was a great privilege, and to see that we've been able to invest in the National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan, which is transformative, is extraordinarily important. It will have five pillars. It will see $250 million going to prevention and early intervention for resilience for all Australians, but particularly young Australians; $350 million going to suicide prevention; $1.4 billion into treatment, for a new national network of treatment centres for adults, for youth and for children, and the Head to Health program, which will stand alongside the headspace program; $100 million for vulnerable Australians, with a particular focus on our Indigenous communities; and $200 million for workforce and governance.\n\nBut, in particular, with regard to suicide prevention, the Prime Minister said to me and to Christine Morgan, 'What's the single thing that will save the most lives?' and Christine Morgan said, as a result of her work, 'Universal aftercare.' That means, for every person who has attempted suicide and has been discharged, having the capacity to have a program that will follow them. There is $158 million for a universal aftercare program. It's something that has been summarised very simply by Suicide Prevention Australia. The head of Suicide Prevention Australia, Nieves Murray, said 'the additional investment in services to support people who have survived a suicide attempt will save lives'. There couldn't be a more important investment.","groups":["First Nations","Young people","People with chronic health conditions"],"issues":["Shelter","Health care\/Health","Prejudice and discrimination","Vulnerable"],"date":1620777600000,"id":"22bad850-8457-44af-8032-cb101d036872","year":2021,"month":5}

It is a great privilege to present that petition. The Uluru statement was a magnificent process, bringing together the First Nations peoples of this nation. We, of course, in the lead-up to that process were in a hopeful phase of bipartisanship in improving our understanding and participating in that process. There was a great deal of hope out there in our Indigenous communities. I want to pay tribute to all the Indigenous nations of my region\u2014the Yuin peoples of the coast, the Ngambri, Ngarigo and Ngunnawal peoples of the high country and the Wiradjuri people of the western regions of my electorate. They have a magnificent tradition and culture that we're very proud of.\n\nI want to praise Michael Brosnan and the crew from Social Justice Advocates of the Sapphire Coast. I was with them on the weekend when they held a wonderful multicultural event in the little town of Wolumla. That event, celebrating 50 different nationalities, brought people from all around the region.\n\nIt is critical that we now deliver for our Indigenous peoples through this Uluru statement. It's a crying shame that up there the Prime Minister will do his acknowledgements of country and do the party trick of having learned a few lines of Indigenous language but he won't follow through. All of that means nothing if we don't follow through on the things that must be done to put our Indigenous peoples where they need to be. This cry from the heart needs to be answered. If we can't get a bipartisan approach to this then Labor will push on. In the absence of cross-party support necessary to achieve that constitutional change in government, Labor will legislate for a voice to honour the aspirations of the Uluru statement, to have that voice to parliament, not in parliament. It's completely outrageous for the Prime Minister to claim this would be a third, additional chamber in this building. It would not be. That's just a sop to try to avoid doing something real in this space. We also won't lose sight of the need for the constitutional guarantee, and we'll continue to work to build the support necessary for a successful referendum in this space.\n\nLabor will also commit to a compensation scheme for the stolen generations and establishment of a healing fund, and will also convene a national summit on First Nations children to address the extremely high rates of child removal. We can't, similarly, sit here and make noises. It was wonderful doing the Sorry statement from Prime Minister Rudd, but the follow-through is what's needed now.

It certainly reduces inconsistency. Currently, families can choose to receive the FTB as fortnightly instalments by making a claim through Centrelink or Medicare Australia. If they want to, however, families can choose to claim the FTB as a lump sum following lodgement of their income tax return at the end of any relevant year. That is quite common for those people who can actually afford it\u2014that is, if they are high income earners or middle income earners. They effectively make a claim for FTB for a past period through Centrelink or Medicare Australia at the same time as they lodge their taxation return. From 1 July this year the option of claiming FTB for the past period through the taxation system will be removed. Removing the taxation system option for delivering FTB payments will, in my view, simplify the system and in the circumstances I am surprised it has not been done in the past.\n\nI had a look at some figures on this. As I said, it was about seven per cent. About 154,164 clients of the system applied for lump sum payments through the Taxation Office. Just over 1,876,000 people\u2014about 90 per cent\u2014applied for fortnightly payments through Centrelink. In my electorate of Blair that has certainly been the experience. Generally speaking, those people who claim the FTB as a lump sum have high incomes\u2014that is, they are very wealthy people in the circumstances\u2014and can afford to wait till the end of the year to see their accountant and make arrangements accordingly. We are doing this by way of reform. We think it is a sensible way to go about it.\n\nThe second aspect of this bill contains a measure announced on 23 October last year. It is based on the recommendations of the Northern Territory Emergency Response Review Board. These amendments make sure that people under the Northern Territory income management regime will have access to the same jurisdictional rights, under SSAT and AAT appeals, as non-Indigenous Australians to income support and family payments. I think that is a fair thing in the circumstances. It allows natural justice to take place. It gives people who are subject to the Northern Territory intervention and the management of their income the same rights as other Australians. In the circumstances that is a good initiative. The income management regime was introduced by the Howard government. It was announced on 21 June 2007. Under the income management regime certain amounts can be deducted from a person\u2019s income management account to meet the priority needs of their dependants, such as food, accommodation, utilities, transport et cetera. That amount is paid into an account controlled by Centrelink.\n\nAn individual can be subject to an IMR for a number of reasons. They are good reasons and they are reasons that protect children in the circumstances. I think that that is a sensible thing in all the circumstances. For example, a person can be subject to an IMR in circumstances where it is necessary to protect the child of that individual or if the individual is subject to the jurisdiction of the Queensland Family Responsibilities Commission and the commission has made a request for the provisions to be applied in the circumstances, if they are a resident of a specified area in the Northern Territory or if their child is deemed to have unsatisfactory attendance at school. Truancy is a challenge and if children do not go to school in certain circumstances, particularly in low socioeconomic areas, they do no have the same capacity to use their skills, talents and abilities in the future.","groups":["First Nations","People on welfare"],"issues":["Government assistance","Finance","Human rights","(In)justice"],"date":1242259200000,"id":"9e727d9f-8878-43c0-a55c-1df89a45f1de","year":2009,"month":5}

I am delighted that Giovanna has been appointed as an executive committee member of the Council for Australia-Latin America Relations, or COALAR, as it is known. It sounds like 'koala', which I thought was quite ironic because Giovanna is actually a crocodile farmer from the Northern Territory. When somebody was talking about COALAR, I was thinking, 'No; it's crocodile,' but anyway it is completely different. Giovanna was in 2013 awarded Northern Territory Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation Rural Woman of the Year, and in that same year she was a finalist in Australian of the Year. So she is quite an extraordinary young woman. She came from Colombia. I was at a function where she said that she is the real Colombian woman\u2014she has still got that very thick Colombian accent and she is a very entertaining and very smart woman. She is going to be able to contribute a lot on this committee, and I am very proud to have her as the Northern Territory representative on COALAR.\n\nThe Deputy Prime Minister, Senator Scullion and I announced, earlier in the week, appointments for former Deputy Chief Minister Michael Reed and Rob Kendrick, who is another good friend of mine, from days gone past. Mike has been appointed as the chair of the Regional Development Australia committee and Rob is his deputy. Mike, as I said, is a former Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. He was in politics from 1987 to 2003 and made an extraordinary contribution to Territorians. So it is wonderful that he is going to be on that committee and provide an insight from the rural Territory. Rob Kendrick is a former police officer who has worked all across the Territory and also has a very good insight into some of the difficulties that we face in the Territory, particularly around infrastructure. So I am really looking forward to working with these two wonderful Territorians, who I believe are going to be able to make a big difference and work to ensure that we, as the Abbott government, are able to implement infrastructure that is going to support the Northern Territory, because we believe that we are leading the charge to develop northern Australia. It is wonderful that they are on that committee and that they share my passion for the Territory.\n\nTalking about RDA funding, I visited the Michael Long Learning and Leadership Centre a couple of weeks ago, and that was a project that received, I think, $7 million of RDA funding. Michael Long is a very well-known Australian, and I am glad that he is a constituent of mine. This facility is just outstanding. I have never seen anything like it in the Territory. It is going to really benefit Indigenous children, particularly those from remote areas. Seeing the vision that Michael had come to fruition is just fantastic. The project is 100 per cent complete. Local builders Sitzler have done a fantastic job, as they do with every build that they are involved in. They always overdeliver. It is not very often that you hear stories about overdelivering, but that is exactly what has happened in this situation.\n\nI would also like to advise you, Madam Speaker, that the Tiger Brennan Drive upgrade is well underway. That was one of my election commitments. The bulldozers are out, just like they are in Sydney. Even though we are in the middle of the wet season, it is all work underway.

{"major_topic":"\nPRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS ","minor_topic":"\nAdhesive Arachnoiditis ","speaker":"Laurie Donald Thomas Ferguson","content":"I was first referred to the issue of adhesive arachnoiditis by a visit from constituent Pamela Romano of Ingleburn. Having undertaken a myelogram in 1972, she was later to endure severe low back pain, leg pain, numbness and chronic pain in the legs and feet, a burning sensation, and bladder and bowel dysfunction, leading to a failed back operation at a later stage. I note the recent recommendations by the roundtable: the need for more information and advocacy that the Australian College of General Practitioners and Medicare Locals provide practitioners with information, that the Australian government through the Australian Research Council supports research projects et cetera. However, I think the fundamental issue is the conduct of GlaxoSmithKline.\n\nIt is not as though this is a recent phenomenon. In 1948, Sweden banned the use of this product and a significant number of other countries followed. It is not as though it is raised for the first time in this parliament by the member for Swan. Back in 2002, the then member for Throsby, Jenni George, raised this same issue in this parliament. We have seen GlaxoSmithKline utilise a barrage of lawyers, who are paid expensive remuneration, to fight against these victims. It was very timely on the weekend when I noticed an article in the Saturday newspaper on the Baryulgil community of northern New South Wales who endured the same sort of attitude from James Hardie, a company thinking that the Indigenous workers would die off and basically that the matter would go into history and no-one would be properly compensated.\n\nIn regard to the resolution by the then member for Throsby, which has been crucially followed by the member for Swan since then, I note the point was made that:\n\nIn October 1994, the then federal minister responsible for therapeutic goods in this country advised the New South Wales minister as follows:\n\nMyodil was a contrast medium used mainly for myelography ... It had a number of adverse reactions; arachnoiditis being one of the more serious.\n\nAs it was in use before the Commonwealth began to evaluate drugs of this class, it was never evaluated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for efficacy and safety.\n\nThat is quite amazing. What we do know, however, is that the company which imported and distributed Pantopaque\/Myodil was advised by the therapeutic goods branch in June 1978 that it was involved in `unauthorised distribution' which `has not been restricted to the \u201capproved end users\u201d but, apparently, has been supplied to all parts of the Commonwealth'.\n\nThere were questions about the use of this product for decades but the company blithely went ahead. As far back as 2008, Dr Dennis Cordato commented:\n\nI am of the opinion that there is a causal link between this and a substance known as myodil \u2026 the inflammation of the arachnoiditis membrane covering the spinal cord and brain.\n\nIn 2005\u2014quite a few years ago\u2014Mark Colvin on \n\nIt is now medically accepted that Myodil is associated with the subsequent development of arachnoiditis.\n\nI have detailed the complaints that my constituent has endured. Clearly there is a large number of sufferers in this country. Clearly GlaxoSmithKline should, very late in the day, take notice of this recent series of recommendations to utilise some of their money to 'raise awareness, support research, coordinate support groups, make representations to government to establish and maintain an Australian case register'.\n\nClearly over time there have been significant indicators that this drug has caused massive problems. Countries would not have banned it if there were not an issue here. Quite frankly, they have had the clear attitude of hoping that they can battle it out, that the number is not that large, that interest is sporadic, although maybe by a few members of parliament more longer term, and that the media occasionally, every four or fix years, might raise it. For people like my constituent, clearly their entire existence has been very severely restricted.

{"major_topic":"\nQUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE ","minor_topic":"\nVocational and Further Education ","speaker":"Andrew John Robb","content":"I thank the member for Bowman for his question and for his very genuine interest in this area. I might begin with the alternative policies, because there I can be brief. In Labor\u2019s much touted \n\nYet we have a rapidly ageing population and the experience of well over a decade of uninterrupted economic growth. This means that we have further challenges. That is why last night we made a further substantial investment of $668 million in vocational and further education. That adds to the $837 million that we announced last November, just six months ago, for the Skills for the Future package. So, in total, in the last six months the government has announced $1.5 billion for technical and further education.\n\nLast night\u2019s announced initiatives were aimed at three things: improving the status, improving the opportunity, and raising the level of vocational and technical education across our workforce. Specifically the measures included, in the trades areas facing a skills shortage, a tax-free $1,000 wage top-up to every first- and second-year apprentice under 30 years of age. On top of that, every first- and second-year apprentice, without age restriction, will get a fee voucher worth up to $500 a go towards their TAFE or other training fees. When you put that together with a trade scholarship, each first- and second-year apprentice across the country in areas of trade skill shortage will get a total of $1,500 a year as a tax-free top-up for their wages and a $500 contribution towards their TAFE fees\u2014nearly $2,000, or up to $2,000, for every first- and second-year apprentice.\n\nThe government also announced the establishment of three more Australian technical colleges, one in southern Brisbane, one in Western Sydney and one in northern Perth. This means that in the five largest cities we will have two technical colleges across the country to combine with the other 18 technical colleges in regional and other cities in Australia. Furthermore, we announced nearly $60 million to develop fast track apprenticeships. We have extended fee help to full fee paying students pursuing diploma and advanced diploma courses through the VET system and we have provided further assistance for our Indigenous community and for people with disabilities to enter the workforce. So, along with the tax cuts and the childcare and the superannuation initiatives last night, these new measures will further expand our productive capacity at a time when the economy is at full stretch.","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Family relations","Work"],"date":1178668800000,"id":"c28b9a3a-8789-44b2-9544-12ab2884909b","year":2007,"month":5}
{"major_topic":"\nADJOURNMENT ","minor_topic":"\nChild Safety and Welfare ","speaker":"Rowan Eric Ramsey","content":"There was a report released today by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare benchmarking where Australia's children are today in relation to their safety and welfare. It highlights the fact that as a nation we need to seriously consider where we are going in relation to child welfare.\n\nThe report tells us that in the last three years child sexual abuse has risen by 26 per cent, substantiated cases of child abuse have surged by 30 per cent and there has been a 30 per cent rise in child neglect. This is all in the same period\u2014the last three years. If alarm bells were not ringing, they should be now. It is time to stand up and bring parents to account for their responsibilities. We need to reflect on what role governments can play and, all too often at the moment, it is to the pick up the pieces at the end and try and rescue the child's life. We know too many grandparents, kinship parents and foster parents who are being asked to take up the role which is the direct responsibility of the parents. The great underlying questions here for us in this parliament are: 'What is going wrong with our family units?' and: 'Is this place contributing to their unravelling?'\n\nCertainly, the time to deliver better education for prospective parents on what their responsibilities are and what bringing a child into the world means is well past. Most of us feel our way through parenthood by relying on the robust role model of our parents that has worked well for millennia. But, sadly, an increasing number of people starting families have not had the advantage of a stable, loving and nurturing upbringing, and in many cases, despite good intentions, they are just not equipped for the job or, indeed, they make the decision to put their needs before their children.\n\nOver 43,000 children are not living with their families, with half of these in kinship care and the other half in foster care. The number of substantiated cases of child abuse have jumped by eight per cent in the last three years and, tragically, 25 per cent of those physically abused in the last three years are Indigenous. I do not want to get off the subject, but that statistic alone should convince any of those who may seek to frustrate the introduction of the cashless credit card trial in Ceduna that is before the Senate at the moment.\n\nWhile we respect the differences in families and the right to nurture in different ways, there are some rules of parenting that are universal. Rule No. 1 will always be to love your children more than you love yourself. Putting children first is not buying them everything they want. It is not letting them misbehave. It is being there for them, taking the time to show them the difference between right and wrong and reinforcing their self-worth. Children need and crave consistency in their lives. They need to know what the rules and boundaries of their behaviour are within the family unit. They need to know both parents are on the same page. They need to attend school. They need a bedtime. They need parents who know where they are and who they are hanging out with.\n\nThere are some excellent parenting programs, and some are school based. And though I am loath to crowd our school curriculum even more, this has to occur where we can have the attention of young people who are our future parents.\n\nAs a society, we also need to say to parents, 'Your children are your responsibility, and it is not acceptable that you put yourself before your children.' I posed the question earlier as to what the driver is of the increasing breakdown of families and what part this place, the parliament, plays in that demise?\n\nI am a conservative by nature, and you may well ask: what does that mean? Well, from my point of view a conservative resists change until convinced that whatever change proposed is going to lead to a change for the better\u2014not that it may be a little better or at least different, or not that others have tried whatever remedy that may be proposed at that time and they like it. I must be convinced that it will\u2014and with the emphasis on 'will'\u2014make for a better outcome.\n\nI am not going to round on any particular decisions that this or previous governments have made that have led to the breakdown of the family unit, but it is worth us all reflecting on the proposition that actions of the past may well have done so. Even more importantly, the actions of the future have the ability to add to the demise of the family unit, or perhaps particularly wise and inspired actions may lead to the arrest of its decline and to the resurrection of the family unit, with all the responsibility that in turn imparts on parents.\n\nSo it is, with these terrible figures released today, that the declining outcomes for children can only be arrested if families step up to the mark\u2014if parents meet their moral responsibilities and know what those responsibilities are and how to execute them. The responsibility for that outcome, at least in part, lies with us here in Canberra.","groups":["First Nations","Young people","People on welfare"],"issues":["Violence","Crime\/criminal justice","Government assistance"],"date":1444780800000,"id":"95d5a5ad-831a-4306-851c-27af5b035216","year":2015,"month":10}

{"major_topic":"\nSTATEMENTS BY MEMBERS ","minor_topic":"\nRacial Discrimination Act 1975 ","speaker":"Tim Watts","content":"Like dogs returning to their vomit, the extreme ideologues of the right-wing of the Liberal Party are at it again trying to gut the Racial Discrimination Act and fighting for the right to be bigots. The Racial Discrimination Act was amended by the Keating government after a number of reports into racially based motivated violence, a royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody, the Law Reform Commission's report into multiculturalism and the law and the need to bring our laws into line with international conventions. The result has been one of the most successful multicultural societies in the world.\n\nBut this harmony, this success leaves a bad taste in the mouth of some of those opposite. The member for Dawson, in May last year, got up in this federal parliament and declared, 'Multiculturalism has failed,' and somehow implied that an acceptance of multiculturalism in Australia implied that we supported honour killings and female genital mutilation. What a nonsense. He has claimed that Halal certification companies only are linked to terrorist organisations and he has spoken at the ugly and divisive Reclaim Australia rallies. He has made the job of our counter-terrorism officials more difficult by damaging the harmony and unity of our community yet the Prime Minister remains silent. Just like Tony Abbott, he fails to call out the extremists in his own party.\n\nThe PM talks a good game on inclusiveness and tolerance but shows his true colours when he fails to condemn members of his own party. He does not lead those opposite; he follows them. And until he calls out the reprehensible, divisive behaviour of those opposite, he can make no claim to leading a united, tolerant multicultural Australia.","groups":["First Nations","Racial minorities"],"issues":["Violence","Prejudice and discrimination","Inclusion\/Exclusion"],"date":1445299200000,"id":"306e111d-1aca-476e-b71f-3b40d3e1fe6b","year":2015,"month":10}
{"major_topic":"\nADJOURNMENT ","minor_topic":"\nForde Electorate: Attack on Animals at Loganlea State High School ","speaker":"Bert Van Manen","content":"The Forde electorate is home to a great many state and private schools which contribute greatly to our community. As the federal member, I am concerned with the welfare of students, teachers and premises. Recently there have been acts of vandalism carried out on some of our schools, the worst of which was an attack on animals at one of our state schools. I was shocked to hear of the recent brutal attack on the poultry compound and horticulture department at Loganlea High School. Loganlea State High School is renowned for its innovative specialist programs, including EMC2 Mathematics for Engineers; targeted literacy and numeracy enhancement programs affiliated with Griffith University; Dance Performance; Sport Development Access; and Knowledge House, an Indigenous education support program. And, as the only metropolitan Gateway School of Agribusiness, its students have preferred enrolment opportunities with the University of Queensland Gatton campus.\n\nIn the early hours of Monday, 7 February the perpetrators entered the compound and ransacked the area, torturing and murdering some of the animals within. These animals had been lovingly cared for by the students. This was a disturbing and violent act that left a number of tame farm animals wounded, missing and deceased. The violent acts were carried out on approximately 15 tame farm animals housed there. The offenders beat and tortured the animals with a steel rake and metal pole. There were 14 animals missing as a result of the attack. I was very saddened to hear of the students being exposed to such cruelty. In an area of the electorate which is one of the less fortunate it was even more disturbing. Chicken and duck eggs were destroyed, a female turkey was decapitated and the school dog \u2018Snowy\u2019 and two pigs, one of which was heavily pregnant, were brutally bashed. Although the school did a wonderful job getting it reopened a week later, many of the community programs that were run from the farm will be not begin again until the animals have recovered. The area is also actively used by those from outside of school\u2014child care centres, nursing homes, the local hospital and some of the special schools.\n\nI commend the school and the principal, Belinda Leavers, for continuing to function as best they can. I would also like to thank PETA for lending a hand to educate local schools on the correct treatment of animals and for distributing emergency humane education materials. The work that PETA does in the community is invaluable, as it teaches young people the importance of treating all living creatures with respect and care. It is integral that we as a community band together to show that this is not an acceptable act and educate our young people as early as possible.\n\nThis was a disgusting act of cruelty which one cannot even comprehend, and my sympathies and support go out to Principal Belinda Leavers and the Loganlea State High School community. I have strongly urged anyone with information on the attack to contact Crime Stoppers. This act has greatly impacted the local community, with many residents outraged at the attack. The local newspapers are currently rife with community members writing in to voice their disgust. These events bring to the fore the caring and supportive community that I represent, and that is indeed an honour. They have banded together to help the school through this difficult time.\n\nIt is my hope that those responsible for the attack will be found to prevent them from escalating their acts of violence. I would like to help in any way possible and, as I noted earlier, I urge anyone with information to come forth to the local police or Crime Stoppers.","groups":["First Nations","Young people","People on welfare"],"issues":["Education","Violence","Crime\/criminal justice","Government assistance","Prejudice and discrimination"],"date":1298937600000,"id":"e62c3d26-a96e-45a4-8b83-b54b09471107","year":2011,"month":3}
{"major_topic":"\nCONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS ","minor_topic":"\nSister Kerry Macdermott ","speaker":"Chris Patrick Hayes","content":"A special job requires a special person. Today I would like to talk about Sister Kerry Macdermott, who is a member of the religious community of Our Lady\u2019s Nurses for the Poor, better known as the \u2018Brown Nurses\u2019. Sister Kerry lives at Minto and oversees a very active Aboriginal Catholic Ministry, which is run by the Diocese of Wollongong. Sister Kerry helped found the Winga Myamly Minto Reconciliation Group in 1993; each year it organises a memorial ceremony at Cataract Dam on the site of the Appin massacre of the Dharawal people in 1816. Her efforts in establishing proper recognition of the massacre have seen the realisation of an opportunity each year for reconciliation and healing for the Indigenous as well as the European community. In 2007 Sister Kerry spent three months working in a remote Aboriginal community outside Alice Springs, tending to the needs of those people. In February 2008 she travelled to Canberra with a group of local Indigenous people to hear the historic apology from the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd.\n\nWhat makes Sister Kerry so special is her total commitment to the people who need help\u2014in particular, the Indigenous people of south-west Sydney. Sister Kerry has upheld the order\u2019s aim of assisting the poor in their homes and always giving them the utmost respect and love. Every day there is an example of this respect and love. Sister Kerry is fearless in her approach and certainly goes out of her way to ensure that she is respected at all levels of government. Sister Kerry has always gone about her work in a way that draws people to her. I very much recognise her strong will, which is necessary for her advocacy, but she certainly displays tenderness and empathy that make the most vulnerable, particularly children, feel wanted and secure. She is always ready to assist anyone in need, whatever the time of day or night, and her own needs are usually placed second to the needs of others.\n\nSister Kerry is not one to seek praise or recognition for her work, as her love for those she cares for and the desire to improve their situation are her only ambition and driving force. Her whole being is dedicated to acting for and loving the poor, and her respect for people, whatever their origin or circumstances, is her trademark. Sister Kerry is a woman to whom the community owes a great debt. She is truly a great Australian and the community of the south-west of Sydney are very much privileged to have known her. It is certainly my privilege to be associated with Sister Kerry Macdermott.","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Voice","Protecting heritage","Vulnerable"],"date":1234310400000,"id":"cfea276f-5ff2-473d-82a3-3a72d4f32304","year":2009,"month":2}
{"major_topic":"\nMINISTERIAL STATEMENTS ","minor_topic":"\nClosing the Gap ","speaker":"Anne Stanley","content":"I start by acknowledging the traditional owners of our country. I acknowledge the Ngunawal and Ngambri people on whose land this parliament meets. I also acknowledge the Dharawal\/Tharawal, Gandangara and Dharug people, the traditional owners of the electorate of Werriwa. I acknowledge country not just because of the convention; I acknowledge our first people because it is the right thing to do, because, in some small way, I want to acknowledge their pain and to add my voice to ensure that recognition and reconciliation are things that we, as a nation, find a way to do as soon as possible.\n\nI am disappointed to be making a speech in the parliament again that will point out that, 12 years since the apology, we are still not anywhere near meeting all of the targets that we set then and only two of the seven have been met. While it is good that the early childhood education and the year 12 attainment targets have been met, it is disappointing there is little change for any of the other five measures, and it's blatantly clear that so much more work needs to be done with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to improve the way they live and their opportunities. It's a tragedy that our First Australians are dying too soon, are educated far less, are incarcerated too often and suffer more preventable disease. The numbers show this tragedy in real terms. Sixty-four per cent of the burden of disease on our First Australians is preventable. The unemployment rate of First Australians is 21 per cent\u2014four times the current non-Indigenous employment rate. Over one-quarter of incarcerated adults in this country are First Australians and nearly half of all juveniles incarcerated are First Australians. The research shows that First Australians are more likely to be incarcerated than African-Americans.\n\nIn 2017, suicide was the leading cause of death amongst our First Australian children aged five to 17. In that same year, one-quarter of all Australian children who died by suicide were First Australians. One in 10 households in public housing is Indigenous. It is the social impact of these raw numbers that should break the hearts of all Australians, but what these statistics don't measure, what they hide in each and every point on a graph, is a person like you and me\u2014it's a mother and father who won't see their baby grow; it's a family that doesn't have parents, aunties or uncles to tell them their history, teach them language or identify their ancestors.\n\nEight Indigenous Australians have been members of this place, and we celebrate their achievement with them, but it is the Constitution of this land that must also celebrate our First Australians. I acknowledge the work of the member for Barton, Linda Burney; Senators Malarndirri McCarthy and Pat Dodson; and the Minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt. There is no question that our First Australians have long been and continue to be the subject of cultural and systemic discrimination. While we can't go back and correct the wrongs of the past, we have the ability and the power to stop those wrongs continuing and stop them now. We just need the will to truly want to change the future.\n\nWe should start with the recognition of our First Australians in the Constitution. We should accept and listen to truth-telling. We need to work with our First Australians to improve their quality of life. This report should be the line in the sand, but we've tried so many times to draw that line. From Wave Hill Station through to Redfern and this place, these lines cannot continue to mark the gap. This gap must close and it must be done here. We must finally end the drawing of such lines. There is no option. We must act and we must end the shameful history of the systemic discrimination against our First Nations people. We have the generational opportunity to improve the lives of our First Australians. We must learn from them, but we must learn with them, and we must close the gap.","groups":["First Nations","Racial minorities","People on welfare","Unemployed or precariously employed"],"issues":["Shelter","Health care\/Health","Voice","Crime\/criminal justice","Protecting heritage","Prejudice and discrimination"],"date":1581552000000,"id":"a36ce817-13f9-41dd-a5fa-7be191487587","year":2020,"month":2}
{"major_topic":"\nPRIVATE MEMBERS\u2019 BUSINESS ","minor_topic":"\nDisability-Inclusive Australian Aid Program ","speaker":"Shayne Kenneth Neumann","content":"I heard the member for Bennelong talking about perceived, alleged Labor government waste. I want to tell him this: under the Howard government profligate spending was rampant. John Howard never found a middle class welfare rort he did not want to fund. We have made $83.6 billion in savings in the last three years\u2014far more than the Howard government ever made. Yet those opposite spend most of their time in the red chamber trying to knock off our savings measures. And they come into this place and have the gall to make statements like those of the member for Bennelong!\n\nWhen Paralympian Kurt Fearnley crawled onto an airline flight in 2009 after refusing to be pushed around in an airline wheelchair, all Australians shuddered. Kurt had just crawled the Kokoda Track and earlier had won his fourth New York wheelchair marathon. I applaud the member for Fremantle for moving this disability inclusive development aid motion and speaking in support of it. Kurt Fearnley demonstrated to us that people living with disabilities can determine what they need and what services should be delivered to them. And domestically the federal Labor government has shown its commitment to antidiscrimination against those suffering from disability by the legislative law reforms we have undertaken and by our commitment to support disability support pensioners and their carers with massive increases in the pension and through secure and sustainable redevelopment of the pension. Our commitment to carers, carer payments and carer allowance is exemplary and it is far more than those opposite ever did during their many years of tenure on the Treasury benches.\u00a0\n\nThis motion recognises the importance of active participation by people with disability in the formulation of policy and the monitoring of funding. The federal Labor government is committed to ensuring that people with disability have the opportunity to reach their full potential as equal citizens and not just objects of charity, which was how they were so often thought of by the Howard coalition government. Just this week the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs launched the National Disability Strategy, a 10-year national plan. Those opposite never had the wit nor the wisdom to do such a thing. It is a plan to improve the lives of Australians with disability, their families and their carers. This is a particularly significant undertaking, done in partnership with the states and territories under COAG. The strategy acknowledges that successful implementation requires collaboration with people with disability. That is what is happening here in Australia.\n\nThe World Health Organisation tells us that 10 per cent of the world\u2019s population is living with a disability, and 80 per cent of those are living in developing countries\u2014many in our neighbourhood, in the Pacific rim and in South-East Asia. Southern Asia is the world\u2019s second most populous region and the World Health Organisation estimates that about 140 million people of all ages in this region are living with a disability. Thirty per cent or 42 million of those are children. High levels of illiteracy, gender disparity and inequality, poverty and child labour may define the socio-economic context of the region and also contribute to the risk of disabilities.\n\nIn South Asia large numbers of children with disability, who struggle daily with additional hardships, are not getting the chance to improve their lives through education. They are the world\u2019s largest marginalised group. In 2008 the federal Labor government ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability, formally ratifying our inherent belief that people with disabilities are entitled to have the same rights as many others and are citizens, not objects of charity.\n\nAll people, including children, deserve the right to full participation in the community. The devastation recently experienced in my home state of Queensland and in Christchurch in New Zealand, and which was climaxed in our thinking in the Japanese earthquake, tsunami and nuclear threat, highlights the timeliness of this motion, and I commend the member for bringing it. Past experience demonstrates that people with disability are more likely to be left behind or abandoned during evacuation in disasters and conflicts. We saw that in Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in the United States.\n\nDuring the Pakistan floods in 2010, 20 million people were affected, killing 1750 and submerging an area larger than the UK. In Australia and New Zealand during the recent crises local governments responded to communities without essential services. However, from time to time we even saw people with disability unable to use the portaloos. It is important for AusAID and the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Defence to continue their engagement with disability-inclusive development policy, particularly when you consider the work that goes on internationally during disasters and conflicts. I commend the member for this motion and I wholeheartedly support it and I condemn those opposite for their failures with respect to disabilities.","groups":["First Nations","Older people","People living in poverty","People on welfare","People with disabilities","General disadvantaged group"],"issues":["Shelter","Education","Voice","Negative emotions","Government assistance","Human rights","(in)equality","Prejudice and discrimination","Inclusion\/Exclusion","Harms and burdens","Poverty"],"date":1300665600000,"id":"02bcdcc4-b661-4172-833d-1980a99fc424","year":2011,"month":3}

{"major_topic":"\nBILLS ","minor_topic":"\nAppropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013; Consideration in Detail ","speaker":"Greg Andrew Hunt","content":"I wish, in the same spirit of brevity as the minister, to place a number of questions on the record. I will let the minister either answer them now or respond on notice. For his assistance and the assistance of his department, we have had some of them prepared in writing and we will table those. Let me begin with a question in relation to the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems CRC. My understanding is that the department, through the Antarctic Division, makes a contribution. I also understand that the CRC is due to expire and is not able to apply for a formal replenishment in 2014. Our view is that this is a highly effective body, that it is well respected and that it is critically linked into the world of the Antarctic Division. The first question is whether the government has any plans to help assist and maintain the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems CRC, whether it has a migratory path for it to exist in the long term or whether it is the government's intention that this CRC will simply stop dead in 2014?\n\nThe second question is in relation to the Caring for our Country budget. In particular, we ask the minister to enumerate all of the different subprograms which have had allocations within the Caring for our Country budget. We understand the three strategic areas which are identified and which have been given separate allocations within the budget. But, within the general division and the other two specific divisions of agriculture and landcare, and Indigenous support for Caring for our Country, we seek a list of all subprograms for which commitments have been made or allocated. I think that would provide great transparency to the budget. I would put it in the context that there are many community groups that have expressed concern that they have not had access to Caring for our Country the way they did under the Natural Heritage Trust and then the Envirofund. That may take some time, but full and complete Caring for our Country budget subprogram descriptions, with actual allocations in the forward estimates against each of those areas for which allocations have been identified, would be much appreciated.\n\nThe third area is in relation to the Heritage Division and the treatment of heritage by the department. I have a series of brief questions, which I will hand to the minister so he and the department can work together on those. First, how many staff members work exclusively on cultural heritage? Second, has this figure gone up or down over the past three years and by exactly how much? Third, are there any plans to increase or reduce heritage staff numbers over the forward estimates period? Fourth, page 68 of the portfolio budget statement appears to show a reduction in funding for heritage grants from $8.42 million in 2012-13 to $4.42 million in the forward estimates period. Is this correct and what is the explanation?\n\nFifth, we understand that the budget cuts last year to the heritage division mean that staff are now struggling to fulfil their statutory obligations, such as assessments and listings. Has there been an increase in the time taken to perform these duties? Sixth, we understand that the Australian Heritage Council has no separate budget and is struggling to fulfil its responsibilities. Are there any plans to address this issue? Seventh, we understand that low staff numbers in the division mean that it is well behind on such assessment matters as the processing and announcement of the York community history grants and assessments and servicing of the Australian Heritage Council. Is the division appropriately funded to enable it to complete the development of the Australian Heritage Strategy?\n\nEighth, the Voluntary Environment, Sustainability and Heritage Organisations grant given to the Federation of Australian Historical Societies has been cut from $30,000 a year for three years to $23\u00bd thousand for one year\u2014that is, from triennial to annual. Why? Ninth, there appears to have been a move away from supporting heritage to supporting environmental organisations. Is this a new policy?

{"major_topic":"\nCONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS ","minor_topic":"\nO'Connor Electorate: Australia Day Awards ","speaker":"Rick Wilson","content":"Like the member for Lilley, I rise to commend some of the citizens from my electorate who received Australia Day Awards. I am not going to name quite as many as the member for Lilley, but I do have three wonderful citizens who were awarded a medal of the Order of Australia. Australia Day is not only an opportunity to welcome new citizens but also a chance for the community and the nation to commend the actions of outstanding Australians. In my electorate of O'Connor, I was proud to see three very worthy citizens awarded a medal of the Order of Australia. The purpose of the Order of Australia is to recognise, by national honour, those who have made outstanding contributions that benefit their communities and ultimately our country. The second purpose of the Order of Australia is that it serves to define; encourage and reinforce community standards, national aspirations and ideals by acknowledging actions and achievements and thereby identify role models at all levels and in all spheres of the community. In Esperance, Pastor Sonny Graham was awarded the OAM for his lifetime of service both to the Indigenous communities and the wider community of Western Australia. Sonny credits his success to the mission where he grew up. After completing his tertiary studies he returned to Norseman as the mission's superintendent. He then began a career in education that extended from the Pilbara to the south coast, working as a linguistics consultant, Aboriginal liaison officer and more. As a Ngadju elder, Sonny has been rebuilding his people's language. He also played a major part in their native title determination which was recognised last year.\n\nKeith Bradby from Albany was awarded his OAM for service to conservation and the environment. In 2002 Keith helped found the Gondwana Link program, a program to protect and restore biodiverse bushland in the South West of Western Australia. Gondwana Link is a world-recognised initiative that has led to changes throughout Australia and around the world. Keith has been actively involved in conservation, biodiversity and community development for nearly four decades. He has held positions in numerous other environmental organisations, such as the Fitzgerald River National Park Association, the Ravensthorpe Land Conservation District Committee and the Western Australian Soil and Land Conservation Council.\n\nPatrick Scallan from Greenbushes has followed in the footsteps of his father, also an Order of Australia medal recipient. Pat received his nomination in recognition of 20 years of service to the Greenbushes community. Pat has had a hand in shaping nearly every aspect of the Greenbushes community: if he was not the president of the Bridgetown-Greenbushes Junior Hockey Club, he was the chairman of the Bridgetown Eco Cultural Discovery Centre, or the vice-president of the Greenbushes Ratepayers and Residents Association\u2014to name just a few of the many hats that Pat has worn in his lifetime. I have had the pleasure of dealing with Pat in his capacity as the secretary of the Greenbushes RSL Sub Branch when I attended the Vietnam Veterans Day celebration last year. Originally from Rhodesia, I think Pat hit the nail on the head when he said: 'It does not matter where you come from, your background, your race, your creed. If you work hard and get stuck in, you are an Aussie.'\n\nCongratulations to all three gentlemen on being recognised with an Order of Australia.

{"major_topic":"\nCONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS ","minor_topic":"\nIsaacs Electorate: City of Greater Dandenong ","speaker":"Mark Alfred Dreyfus","content":"I would like to congratulate the City of Greater Dandenong, which last night in Parliament House was presented with the National Award for Local Government in the category of Multicultural Australia\u2014Strength in Diversity. The National Awards for Local Government are an annual celebration of Australian local government achievements. Through the awards, the Australian government celebrates local government projects that are innovative, deliver better outcomes for communities, have the potential to be rolled out across the country and make a meaningful difference. In particular, I would like to congratulate Mayor Jim Memeti and Councillors Youhorn Chea, Angela Long and Matthew Kirwan, who, together with Jackie Gatt, the council's officer, were in Canberra to receive the award for the council's 'Racism. Get Up. Speak Out' program. It was a pleasure to see them all here.\n\nAt a council meeting on 26 June last year, the Greater Dandenong City Council unanimously pledged support for the National Anti-Racism Strategy's campaign 'Racism. It Stops with Me.' The campaign, launched by the Australian Human Rights Commission in 2012, has been underpinned by key research findings which suggest that one in seven Australian says that they experience discrimination because of their colour or background; approximately one in five Australians says they have experienced race hate talk, such as verbal abuse, racial slurs or name calling; around one in 10 Australian says they have experienced race-based exclusions in the workplace or social events; and more than one in 20 Australians says they have been physically attacked because of their race.\n\nThe campaign, embraced by the City of Greater Dandenong in the form of its 'Racism. Get Up. Speak Out' program, aims to raise awareness about racism and its effect on individuals and communities; give individuals and organisations tools and resources to take practical actions against racism; and empower individuals and organisations. It was for this bold and innovative campaign that the council won its national award last night.\n\nIn addition, I note that, on 29 April this year, the City of Greater Dandenong made a formal submission opposing the Abbott government's attack on the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, provisions that protect our communities against racist hate speech. I congratulate the council for emphatically rejecting Senator Brandis's view that 'people do have a right to be bigots'. In its cover letter, the council said:\n\nAs a Victorian municipality with sixty per cent of residents born overseas, the City of Greater. Dandenong celebrates diversity and proactively seeks to address local racial discrimination. \u2026 Anti-racism is a matter of strong sentiment in this municipality.\n\nThe council also pointed out:\n\nWithin Greater Dandenong, those most affected by this amendment would include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and members of certain religious groups, many of whom experience discrimination on a regular basis.\n\nI again congratulate the City of Greater Dandenong council for the local government award they won and for their strong opposition to the government's proposed changes.","groups":["First Nations","Racial minorities"],"issues":["Violence","Human rights","Prejudice and discrimination","Diversity"],"date":1403049600000,"id":"567fa54f-8a32-4815-89b9-693b2360b5e8","year":2014,"month":6}
{"major_topic":"\nMATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE ","minor_topic":"\nBudget ","speaker":"Kelvin John Thomson","content":"The government has gone back to the three-word slogans. We are hearing about Operation Budget Repair. I know that the three-word slogans worked a treat in opposition, but they are no way to run a government. But, if it is going to be three-word slogans, how about Operation Cut Unemployment? We now have unemployment at 6.4 per cent nationally, the highest level in 12 years, with 789,000 Australians out of work. In my home state of Victoria unemployment has now reached the quite unacceptable level of seven per cent. Youth unemployment in Victoria is at an even more disturbing 15 per cent.\n\nThe Liberal government is undermining young Australians looking for work with its savage cut of $1.2 billion to income support for people under 30. From 1 January next year, job seekers under 30 who need Newstart and youth allowance will be forced to wait six months before receiving any support. As a delegation from the Australian Council of Social Service, who visited me this week, pointed out, 'What will they live on if they cannot find a job?' Requiring job seekers to apply for 40 jobs each month is ludicrous. The jobs simply are not there. It is simply a recipe for red tape for business. This budget risks condemning a generation of young Australians to a vicious cycle of poverty.\n\nIf it is going to be all about slogans, how about 'operation keep your word'? They promised to take the pressure off the cost of living, but then they cut child care and increased the cost of pharmaceuticals. They promised no new or increased taxes and then gave us a new GP tax and raised the tax on petrol. They promised no cuts to health and then cut $50 billion from hospitals. They promised no cuts to education and then cut $30 billion from schools, $1 billion from skills and $5 billion from universities. They promised no increase in university fees, but fees are set to double and triple. They promised to create a million new jobs, but unemployment is on the rise and youth unemployment in Victoria is at 15 year highs. The Prime Minister promised to be the Prime Minister for Aboriginal affairs and then cut $500 million from essential health and services. They promised no change to pensions but then cut pensions by $23 billion over the next 10 years\u2014$80 a week from the pockets and purses of pensioners.\n\nOn this day last year at Rooty Hill, the then opposition leader, now Prime Minister, promised Australians 'no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts or changes to pensions'. What a difference a year makes. And Education Minister Pyne said in a media release of 26 August last year, just over a year ago:\n\nWhile we welcome debate over the quality and standards in our universities, we have no plans to increase fees \u2026\n\nWhat is he saying a year later? Last weekend he said student protesters should 'get some perspective' because the government is 'not exactly asking for their left kidney'. Well, I checked this out, and it turns out to be even worse than that. I looked up the Transplant Australia website. It says the cost of a kidney transplant from a live donor is $75,000 and the cost of a kidney transplant from a deceased donor is $65,000. So getting a new left kidney would be less costly than the debts many graduates are going to pay if this government's budget passes.\n\nUnder this budget, university fees are set to double and triple. The government wants to cut funding for undergraduate places by up to 37 per cent, deregulate fee levels and allow universities to charge what they like and, outrageously, introduce a compounding real interest rate of six per cent for all student debts. We will see science degrees increase from the current average of $44,000 up to $170,000 over 20 years; nursing degrees rise from $23,000 to $62,000; and teaching degrees rise from $32,000 up to $87,000.\n\nThis is not a government of adults. This is a government of intergenerational warriors taking the under-25s off Newstart and fitting students up with 60 per cent of the cost of their education. It is a shameful way to treat our young people, and this government should be condemned for this unfair, short-sighted, incoherent dog's breakfast of a budget.","groups":["First Nations","Young people","Older people","People living in poverty","People on welfare","Unemployed or precariously employed"],"issues":["Government assistance","Finance","Cycles of disadvantage","Poverty"],"date":1409184000000,"id":"52b8edf4-f0a2-491e-952e-ea3e0e9dbc1e","year":2014,"month":8}
{"major_topic":"\nQUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE ","minor_topic":"\nNAIDOC Week ","speaker":"Ken Wyatt","content":"I want to thank the member for Herbert for his ongoing advocacy in this important and key area. NAIDOC Week is an opportunity for all Australians to celebrate and engage with history and the achievement of Indigenous Australians. It's a time for us to reflect on and understand our nation's shared history and how we can learn from practices reaching back 65,000 years to better inform our actions of today. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were the first of many: Australia's first explorers and navigators, first scientists and engineers, and first astronomers and artists. The Morrison government acknowledges this, and that's why we are working to empower all Indigenous Australians and ensure that we utilise Indigenous knowledge in developing programs and policies that better all Australians.\n\nLast week, the Minister for the Environment, the minister for agriculture and I announced the opening of a $2 million grants round to strengthen and share traditional knowledge and practices in respect of Indigenous fire and land management practices. This builds on the findings of the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements, which called for all governments to further engage with Indigenous owners to explore the role Indigenous land and fire management practices can play in improving Australia's resilience to natural disasters and the management of public land.\n\nEmpowering Indigenous Australians goes beyond the work of our government. We are a partner with the Indigenous Australians and state and territory governments through the priority reforms we are implementing in programs and policies that address the refreshed targets in a national Closing the Gap agreement. Indigenous Australians must be seated at the table in this decision-making. But we know Indigenous Australians are more than capable of excelling in their own right. This morning I was honoured to visit DXC Technology here in Canberra to launch their reconciliation action plan\u2014a practical and tangible example of how businesses are investing in Indigenous Australians and creating opportunities for individuals to reach their potential.\n\nOur role is to enable an environment where Indigenous voices are heard, Indigenous knowledge is accepted and Indigenous enterprises are supported. A practical example of this is the government's Indigenous Procurement Policy. Empowering Indigenous people in key decisions on how businesses are run or projects are implemented is critical to improving the broader economic outcomes. From 1 July 2020 the Commonwealth's value based target will rise from one per cent to 1.2 per cent. This will sit alongside the existing three per cent volume based targets and they will increase the opportunities post COVID. Our culture is as important today as it was 65,000 years ago, and their involvement in shared decision-making is a strength that our government will take forward.

{"major_topic":"\nADJOURNMENT ","minor_topic":"\nCommunity Health Research ","speaker":"Shayne Kenneth Neumann","content":"Recently I had the privilege of attending the University of Queensland Ipswich Campus, where I met with Robert Bush PhD, Professor of Community Health Research, and Dr Kathryn Ahern, from the School of Nursing and Midwifery. The University of Queensland Ipswich Campus is the location of the Healthy Communities Research Centre, which was established in September 2007 and is an international hub for community health research. The centre arose in part from a population health profile of the Ipswich and West Moreton Division of General Practice, and I commend former CEO Kevin Pitman, who had the foresight to seek Australian government funding for that study, which was conducted by the Public Health Information Development Unit at the University of Adelaide, South Australia. The study established that the socioeconomic status of the Ipswich and West Moreton area was lower than Brisbane\u2019s and also lower than the Australian average. There were more single-parent families and a high proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, full-time secondary education participation was lower and more households were receiving rent assistance. Health indicators also showed the local community was more disadvantaged in terms of respiratory system diseases, asthma, circulatory system diseases, diabetes, injury, mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal system diseases, obesity and overweight generally. Sadly, also, the number of smokers was much higher and people were more physically inactive.\n\nAs a result of that study, the Ipswich Hospital Foundation decided to strengthen the focus of research in the local area and, with the participation of the University of Queensland, came up with the idea of the Healthy Communities Research Centre. It will carry out a longitudinal study that will be known as the Ipswich Study, examining health related projects and the interface between the various determinants of health using both longitudinal and comparative methodologies. It will be looking to integrate what should be done in terms of future growth in communities. This is being done because Ipswich will grow faster than any other area in South-East Queensland. Because it is also an area of low socioeconomic status, it is a perfect laboratory for this kind of study. People at the Healthy Communities Research Centre are very excited about this prospect because Ipswich is a mixture of urban, rural and cultural communities, with substantive changes taking place. So this rapidly changing environment will be the perfect catalyst for this type of study.\n\nProfessor Bush said recently that the Ipswich study can become the hub around which an international centre for research on community health can be built. But, of course, it needs support. I am pleased to say that the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland has provided funding of $300,000 to employ a research fellow for the study, Dr David Marshall, who joined the centre in July this year. However, the study also needs the support of the local community, not just of the council but of other partnerships, business and local, individuals and community organisations, churches, charities, the RSL and sporting and other community groups. It needs sufficient funding, both federal and state, as well as from the University of Queensland.\n\nThe study will go a long way to assist the objectives of the state government\u2019s South-East Queensland Regional Plan to secure well-designed, safe and healthy local communities. It will also encourage active community participation in these types of events, because we have to plan things properly. We have to plan our hospitals, our health services, our roads and our schools. Just south of where I live, 120,000 people will live in the Ripley Valley in the next 20 years. We have got to plan properly, and we need the research to be able to do that. The Ipswich Study is very important for this reason. I urge the local community, including the local council, to get behind this study. This is worthwhile and will create an international hub for future development. It will be great for South-East Queensland and great for Ipswich.","groups":["First Nations","People with chronic health conditions","Single parents"],"issues":["Health care\/Health","Voice","General disadvantage"],"date":1226534400000,"id":"27388ed6-cc26-433f-b504-68ad31524a7d","year":2008,"month":11}
{"major_topic":"\nBILLS ","minor_topic":"\nAppropriation Bill (No. 1) 2019-2020; Consideration in Detail ","speaker":"Ged Kearney","content":"I welcome the opportunity to raise an incredibly important issue: the need to free the Aboriginal flag. A company called WAM Clothing, owned by a non-Indigenous Australian, was given exclusive rights to reproduce the Aboriginal flag on clothing by artist Harold Thomas, who designed the flag in 1971. There is also copyright over it being reproduced digitally. I'm not even entirely sure what that means. I don't know about many of you, but I have the Aboriginal flag along with the Torres Strait Islander flag on my email signature, which goes out every time I send an email. I might soon have to pay for the benefit of doing that.\n\nWAM Clothing have started issuing cease-and-desist notices to companies who use the flag, including an organisation called Spark Health, which is an Indigenous social enterprise that works in my electorate of Cooper. My incomparable colleague the member for Barton, who I'm terribly proud to stand beside and be a part of the same party as, has an Aboriginal flag tattooed on her shoulder which, under the agreement between WAM Clothing and Mr Thomas, may well be a breach of copyright. They are going further and further with this. An Aboriginal Indigenous health charity had to pay $2,200 to use the Aboriginal flag on T-shirts that it gives away to patients who attend the clinic. Knowing they will get a T-shirt with the flag on it is an incentive for Aboriginal people to attend a health clinic. But they have had to take the flag off their T-shirts because of the agreement between WAM Clothing and Mr Thomas.\n\nI ask this: should WAM Clothing, a non-Indigenous business, control the market and profit from the resistance, resilience and perseverance of Indigenous people? To quote the member for Barton:\n\nThe flag is one of our national symbols and a central part of Aboriginal and Australian identity. The flag should be about people and pride, not profit.\n\nDisplaying the three flags\u2014the Aboriginal flag, the Torres Strait Islander flag and the Australian flag\u2014together has become a sign of struggle, of pride and of a reconciled future. This is an important issue for so many Australians. The Pride not Profit petition created by Spark Health now has over 48,000 signatures; 48,000 people are in support of this message calling for a change to the current licensing agreement around the Aboriginal flag, with their common goal being freeing the flag from copyright.\n\nWhile there's no need for anyone to get permission to use the Australian flag so long as they abide by the guidelines respecting its use, this is not the case for the Aboriginal flag. The formidable former senator Nova Peris had this to say about the situation:\n\nWe want equal rights to our flag like other Australians have equal rights to their flag. When you look at that flag it's symbolic of us as a race of people that goes back 50,000 years, even though it's only 48 years old.\n\nThe copyright of the flag is valid for Harold Thomas's life plus another 70 years, so potentially we're looking at another hundred years until the rights of the flag can enter the public domain. In terms of the nation, the most public pieces of public property are flags. Locally, there's an inherent contradiction when the Aboriginal flag is privately owned.\n\nThe Australian government recognised and proclaimed the Aboriginal flag in 1995 and again in 2018 under the Flags Act; therefore, there is a legitimate expectation of free use of that work as a flag. The federal government must do more to protect the flag, which for some is being held hostage. The member for Barton has said that the situation is untenable. It's unthinkable that the use of the Aboriginal flag is now governed by a secret agreement at the discretion of a for-profit company. It's a discredit to the flag's history and the strength it represents. The Australian Indigenous people want no more and no fewer rights to their Aboriginal flag then we have to the Australian flag or the Torres Strait Islander flag.\n\nThe effect of the deal between WAM and Harold Thomas is that the Aboriginal flag will start to disappear from view. This is already happening, with a number of organisations, large and small, removing the flag from clothing in fear of high costs and legal battles to use it. The Aboriginal flag is an important symbol to Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians alike, and it must be able to be used freely without fear of prosecution or exorbitant costs. I commend the work of Spark Health, Dreamtime Kullilla-Art and each and every organisation and individual who has added their voice to the call to free the flag. In the words of Laura Thompson:\n\nThe flag represented a struggle and a resistance movement, and now it just feels like a struggle to use it.\n\nMy question is: what resources and efforts are you putting into finding a fair and equitable resolution to ensure that the Aboriginal flag remains just that\u2014a national flag?","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Government assistance","Human rights"],"date":1568851200000,"id":"4e97ca42-c393-4cf0-9896-09bb59f3a6d0","year":2019,"month":9}
{"major_topic":"\nPRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS ","minor_topic":"\nInternational Mother Language Day ","speaker":"Julie Ann Owens","content":"I move:\n\nThat this House:\n\n(1)acknowledges:\n\n(a)that 21 February is International Mother Language Day (IMLD);\n\n(b)the work of the Ekushe Academy Australia and the Mother Language Conservation Movement in creating awareness of the importance of mother languages in Australia;\n\n(c)that 2019 is the Year of Indigenous Languages; and\n\n(d)that about 200 different languages are spoken throughout Australia; and\n\n(2)calls on the Australian Government to:\n\n(a)observe IMLD on 21 February;\n\n(b)promote the preservation and protection of all languages used by people around the world, especially in Australia;\n\n(c)build on Australia's multilingual strengths including support for second language education in Australian education institutions; and\n\n(d)actively work to support communities in their efforts to preserve their mother language.\n\n21 February is International Mother Language Day. It gives me the opportunity to celebrate the richness of language in my community and to talk about two of Labor's policies to grow our language skills. Language allows us to transmit meaning. For each culture, language holds significant history, traditions and identity, and meanings that are quite often specific to that language. It is also a doorway to other cultures, knowledge exchange and trade. We are a very lucky country to have so many languages spoken in our communities. It is in the interest of the families, human understanding and our economy to grow that capacity.\n\nInternational Mother Language Day was established in 2000. The date of 21 February corresponds with the day in 1952 when students were protesting for the recognition of Bangla as one of the national languages of East Pakistan, now known as Bangladesh. During the demonstration, four young students were shot dead. So it is a day of special significance to Bangla speaking people in Australia, and I have worked with them for many years to raise the profile of this day. I would like to make special mention of Nirmal Paul, who is the founder and chairperson of Mother Languages Conservation International, and Dr Swapan Paul, who is the president of the Ekushe Academy Australia. Both of these organisations have a mission to raise awareness of the importance of mother language in the Australian community\u2014and they do a remarkable job.\n\nAnd there is a lot to be aware of. In my community, just in the community of Parramatta, there are 110 languages spoken at home. All of the languages spoken add to the vibrancy of our community, and I am proud of the diversity and richness in which we live. Labor has two particular policies aimed at fostering that richness. On Saturday we announced a plan to get more Australian children learning languages. A Shorten Labor government, if elected, will invest an extra $8 million in community language schools so that more Australian children get the chance to learn other languages.\n\nThe parents and grandparents in Parramatta who were born overseas probably know all about community language schools, but there are many who don't. They have been operating in Australia for more than 150 years. There are 700 of them, teaching over 100,000 students in over 80 languages, with literally thousands of volunteer teachers and very committed parents. That includes Akan Education Learning Program, in Granville; Our Lady of Lebanon Arabic School, in Harris Park; the Bangla Language School, in Rosehill; the Shua Community Language School, in Granville; the Afghan Community Language School and the Afghan Cultural School, in Parramatta, which both teach Dari; the South Asian Australian Association, in Parramatta, which teaches Hindi; and just outside my electorate the Wentworthville Tamil Study Centre, which teaches Tamil. The $25,000 grants that will be available through the program will make a real difference and will allow these committed groups of parents and teachers to extend their services to three-and four-year-olds. So children will be exposed to these languages and learn the skills of language at an even younger age, which is incredibly important for our future prosperity as a nation and for the strength of the communities among us.\n\nBut we also need to improve efforts in schools. A Shorten Labor government will also make Asian languages and literacy a national priority and invest $32 million to strengthen Asian language and literacy education in schools. The number of students studying Asian languages has actually been stagnating in recent years. It is a surprise, because you would expect it to be different. As a nation, we have been stagnating. We are in one of the fastest growing regions in the world, with a natural capacity for language in our community, and we are not grabbing the opportunity with both hands. We should be. If elected, Labor will increase the number of Asian language teachers, we will improve Asian language curriculum materials from preschool to year 12 and we will set ambitious targets and goals for Asian languages. A Shorten Labor government will get more Australians studying Asian languages to ensure the next generation is prepared for the jobs and economic opportunities of the Asian century.\n\nAs we celebrate International Mother Language Day on 21 February, let's celebrate the richness and diversity that language brings to our community but let's also acknowledge the imperative to grow and develop this strength so that our children and grandchildren can better understand their cultural background and talk to their grandparents in their first language but also so that our strength in languages links us to the world as only a common language can. We are indeed a lucky country. If elected, Labor will invest in the richness of our multilingual population. Happy 21 February, happy International Mother Language Day to all my community, particularly those who speak Bangla.","groups":["First Nations","Racial minorities","LGBTIQ+"],"issues":["Education","Voice","Protecting heritage","Diversity"],"date":1550448000000,"id":"d637904b-2ff2-423d-bf69-9a95b8d39eb8","year":2019,"month":2}
{"major_topic":"\nBILLS ","minor_topic":"\nCommunications and the Arts Portfolio ","speaker":"Graham Douglas Perrett","content":"My question to the minister is about the budget's impact on the arts in Australia. Let's face it, Minister, it's been a six-year-long winter of discontent for the arts community in Australia. As the coalition enters its seventh year in government, its legacy sounds like a film director on speed\u2014cut, cut, cut and cut again, when it comes to the arts. Let's look at some of this shameful legacy. It ended Creative Australia as a cultural policy and replaced it with nothing\u2014zip, nada, nothing at all. That was certainly creative. It has delivered cuts to the Australia Council, cuts to training institutions, cuts to the ABC and to the SBS, despite promises to the contrary at Panthers Leagues Club. And, not content with cutting, this Big Brother coalition government even tried to tell artists what they should produce and how they should perform. That alone shows a total lack of understanding of the arts and artists in a country that values freedom.\n\nCreative arts in Australia have a very proud and long history. Indeed, it is almost as old as the continent itself. First Nations artists tell their stories through their art, songlines, dances and battles. Their hopes and dreams have lived on in this land through their artistry, in the world's oldest continuing culture.\n\nWe have many great Australian artists whose work is renowned throughout the world through their acting, words or music. But since the 2014-15 budget, Australia Council funding has been a significant issue for the arts sector. In that budget, arts programs generally were cut by $87.1 million over four years, including a cut of $28.2 million to the Australia Council. In the 2015-16 budget there was a further cut of $13.2 million under Treasurer Morrison to the arts sector, including a cut of $7.2 million to the Australia Council. There was a further announcement in that budget that greater emphasis would be placed on funding existing major performing arts companies, leaving many emerging artists unfunded, particularly in regional Australia. The Australia Council has opened multiyear grants for funding. The four-year funding rounds will lock out unsuccessful organisations from applying for funding again for another four years.\n\nIn Queensland, some organisations that are currently funded by the Australia Council have applied under the multiyear funding and been rejected before progressing through to the full application stage. I'll mention some of these great Australian art institutions. The Brisbane Writers Festival, which was on last weekend, champions curiosity and creativity in Queensland, connects Queensland's reading and writing communities through transformative cultural experiences that elevate the vitality of literacy, arts and contribute to the dynamic public conversation. It's a Brisbane institution that attracts thousands of creative and literary Queenslanders to showcase literature and celebrate stories. It's been knocked back at the first hurdle for future funding from the Australia Council\u2014disgraceful. Eyeline Publishing, which publishes an Australian contemporary art magazine and brings together exhibition and book reviews, artist interviews and monograph specialist columns and research articles on people and issues that are shaping the arts today, also stumbled at the first hurdle. The Queensland Art Gallery & Gallery of Modern Art hold a collection of over 17,000 works of historical, modern and contemporary art. It is a great place to visit as an adult or to take your kids. I can testify to that. It was also refused at the first post for future Australia Council funding.\n\nMinister, this government seems to completely misunderstand how important the creative arts are to Australia and the trading opportunities that come by having that soft projection through our arts into the rest of the world. The arts make sure that Australians understand ourselves and how the rest of the world sees us, how we are understood as a country, how we understand each other better, and how the world comes to understand us. We can work alongside trade opportunities. When there is tension around things, we can use the arts as a great way to make connections. My question to the minister is: how will these very important arts institutions, particularly the ones mentioned in Queensland that are open to all of Australia but particularly service the Brisbane and Queensland communities, continue to operate without the certainty of funding?","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Education","Freedom"],"date":1568246400000,"id":"d5808a1f-748b-473c-96cc-e6357924eeb3","year":2019,"month":9}
{"major_topic":"\nSTATEMENTS BY MEMBERS ","minor_topic":"\nIndigenous Australians: Yuendumu ","speaker":"Andrew Charles Laming","content":"Two weeks ago Constable Zachary Rolfe went to the Aboriginal community of Yuendumu to arrest 19-year-old Kumanjayi Walker. What followed was a shooting, which is a tragedy for Central Australia and for two families from two corners of our great nation. Walker had been in jail, charged with aggravated assault and assaulting police. Once freed, he breached his suspended sentence by returning to Yuendumu. Police had to act. As we know, at their first attempt police fled when he swung at them with a hatchet. Days later staff at the local medical clinic were evacuated for safety reasons. After a funeral, another date was negotiated. At that time, Rolfe was stabbed in the shoulder with scissors before then having the other police officer attacked but protected by his bulletproof vest. The shooting followed. It's all on video.\n\nOn Monday, the new police commissioner started work. With riots likely, the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Michael Gunner, announced an independent investigation. On the same day Rolfe's photo and name were leaked. The next day Rolfe was charged with murder and put in jail, allegedly before the DPP had even seen the body cam imagery.\n\nThe Chief Minister has offered, 'a healing process and going back to normal'\u2014no mention of justice. What is normal, Chief Minister, in Yuendumu? Having been personally subjected to an incompetent, fumbling and ultimately abortive investigation myself in 2007, my simple question is: how extensive was this investigation and was the body cam footage seen by the DPP?","groups":["First Nations"],"issues":["Violence","Crime\/criminal justice","(In)justice"],"date":1574726400000,"id":"60dbc234-0235-47d3-9db5-443c5a8a1112","year":2019,"month":11}
